the debate is closed
hence the report
hence our theory

detrimental with regard to agriculture
i will mention five
not everybody gets everything
the negotiations were indeed difficult
it could have been worse
this is beyond me

that is a fact
and why not
why

this is my second question
these issues are important
that is a practical question

how can we accept this
what does this mean
we will all be happy '

this work must have support
thank you  commissioner
this needs to be remedied
i certainly hope so
it is sometimes regional
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
where does that get us
the debate is closed
these nets should be banned
the debate is closed
thank you  mrs hautala

these emission allowances must lapse
that is a massive amount
the debate is closed

i really regret this decision
let things stay that way

what should it be about
no  indeed not
this is no surprise
such an elegant provocation
interruption
applause
this must be changed
applause
this is unacceptable
time is pressing
rapporteur
no human work is perfect
so let us incorporate it
the charter is important
this  however  cannot be believed
they must also become binding
we cannot forget this
the debate is closed
statement in writing  rule 120
why
that  though  is quite nonsensical
that is not all  however
we do not know
it is a mystery
we do not know
what are these differences
we will support this report
this is true
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
it was a misunderstanding
the debate is closed
medicinal products
there are three
why
why is this so important
how will this happen
it is a prudent proposal
the procedure must be transparent
i see this as important
this is unacceptable
why is this
applause from the right
we must be consistent here
think about that
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
written statement  rule 120
first  the legal base
secondly  trade
thirdly  identification
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
president
it makes you wonder
the suspense is excruciating
immigration is an asset
section iii   commission
section i   european parliament
section ii   council
this is completely preposterous
heading 2  the structural funds
i think this is absurd
it is a joint undertaking
0 3% for germany
well done  sweden
one such example is enlargement
this worked out well
i would add something further
how much will enlargement cost
that is the question
first point
rigour is the watchword
employment depends on it
i see a further problem
we are losing revenue
these forecasts were dismissed
thank you for this contribution
the debate is closed
this is the good news
part ii
questions to commissioner schreyer

thank you very much  commissioner
questions to commissioner vitorino
thank you  commissioner

the debate is closed
interjection by mr bourlanges
this is a good thing
the debate is closed
the analysis is under way
i support the report
a genuine joint action
the text is very clear
i agree
this is nonsense
now some specific comments
benchmarking has been referred to
i spoke about that earlier
thank you very much  commissioner
the debate is closed
that is clearly ridiculous
the debate is closed
i ask you
why is that the case
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
that is very important
this is unacceptable
why is this so
and why is that so
it voted 'no'
vote 'yes' or disappear
why do they do nothing
allow me a final comment
the eu honours its agreements
we stand our ground
this is one problem
no new conditions
now we are almost there
we are approaching our destination
we are getting there
applause
applause
mixed reactions
laughter and applause
parliament adopted the decision
parliament adopted the decision
before the vote
our fears are being confirmed
examples of this are
which will take precedence
where have we failed
i sincerely doubt it
thank you  mr president
this is not enough
our grassroots support needs this
this role is crucial
anybody at all
what more can one add
that is a fatal message
this is what is required
it requires extra efforts
secondly  multilateral action
thank you  commissioner
the world changed
this is to be welcomed
there are 70 measures
you are wrong
thank you  commissioner
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
that code is not binding
subject  international criminal court

subject  the eu and macedonia
subject  human rights
that is something quite different
this is unacceptable
the debate is closed

applause
applause
the debate is closed
and he has succeeded admirably
they make money

thank you for those clarifications
parliament adopted the resolution
this is indeed extremely gratifying
lies  i suppose
what shall we do
what are the objectives
and so we should
so first things first
remember that
that is correct
and another thing
perhaps there is a connection
this debate will certainly continue
thank you commissioner
that is specifically ruled out
it is there  in print
the debate is closed
the latest reports are frightening
not a moment before  however
thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
thank you very much  commissioner
the debate is closed
parliament adopted the resolution
resumption of the session

applause
applause
both these things are true

the debate is closed
the joint debate is closed

wednesday
parliament agreed to the request

that is the question
i say yes  we do
far from it
yes  of course it is
is this wise
we have done that
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
c5 0331/2002   2002/2175 cos ]
truly impressive
reform is not the solution
this is a fact
what shall we do  therefore
we must keep our heads
it does not make sense
it makes no sense
it is not a coincidence
it beggars belief
nobody is disputing that
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
this needs to be ratified
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
applause
applause
applause
this would be a mistake
this serves a practical purpose
that has to be clarified
it is beyond me
thank you mr coûteaux
it is a real danger
this must be welcomed
thank you
your comments have been noted
i have two questions
for ever
together we will succeed
i condemn this move
is it not beyond belief
that is the main problem
thank you very much  commissioner
the debate is closed
they set political priorities
i fully agree with her
i think this sounds excellent
i find this extraordinary
this is an ongoing battle
we are on track
silence please
the debate is closed
before the vote
these amendments are compatible
parliament adopted the resolution
parliament adopted the text
parliament adopted the text
parliament adopted the text
parliament adopted the text

loud applause and heckling
laughter and loud applause
this is a second reading
joint motion for a resolution
generosity will vary
1
2
dissuasive and uniform sanctions
we must stop this hypocrisy
i find this intolerable
very well  mr wynn
secondly  chechnya
this is not the problem
so how have we reacted
stick at it
this is an intolerable situation
who influenced you
this was an historic moment
the debate is closed
that is clear
temporary means temporary
that is legal mumbo jumbo
that is very important
i wager it would not
i agree with her
that discussion was very fruitful
i ardently support the ban
the debate is closed
finally  the new scientific committee
what is in it
what do they fear
let us welcome it
the debate is closed
that is a fact
this is intolerable
that is absolutely right
that is wishful thinking
that is not so
there is none
that takes the biscuit
that is a good suggestion
the remaining amendments are rejected
the debate is closed
the report rejects this position
the debate is closed
eib annual report  2001
my final point concerns monitoring
thank you very much
the debate is closed
you mentioned various alternatives
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
applause
transparency is not guaranteed
loud applause
parliament adopted the resolution
it is the greens
the social reality is intractable
no they are not
this helps smes
we therefore abstained
that concludes voting time
the debate is closed
it was a fascinating exercise
the debate is closed
clearly  the answer is no
many of them are good
inadequate for two reasons
until when
that is enough
it needs to be applied
how many more
well  that is my point
we are working on this
the second issue
applause
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
iran is a complex society
the debate is closed
that is all  mr president

applause
we fear the worst
but what did you write
was it you
was it some secretary
we want reform
thank you very much
that is the reason
what for
and do you know why
that is all
this dialogue is very important
i still maintain that criticism
first  the praise
what are the deadlines
how about that
today  things have changed
a great deal
this story is paradoxical
what did you actually do '
is this reasonable
it must succeed
turkey is a candidate
that is precisely the problem
that is the full background
that concludes the debate
written statement  rule 120
and
we are all equal here
what happened
we have made progress
omnia tempus habent
let us be honest therefore
it consists of three parts
we are special
confused
i certainly am
that is one problem
the answer is yes
i said that quite clearly
that concludes the joint debate
'nunca mais'   never again
thank you very much
and
i do not think so
that is an emergency measure
help us  help the galicians
let us stop being hypocritical
thank you all very much
we need to go further
this plunder must stop
these waters must be protected
quite the opposite
sad  but true
parliament is on your side
fine
now to the proposed amendments
the debate is closed
no it does not
the debate is closed
so what next
the debate is closed
progress is painfully slow
i grant you that
i agree with that
the debate is closed
and that they certainly can
is it being duplicated
the debate is closed
that must be our goal
the debate is closed
applause
applause
what is at stake here

how is that to happen
why do i say that

and what has happened
the debate is closed
that is remarkable

i think not
what do we do now
i opposed this
that is untrue
we have evidence in plenty
that was the reality
the report admits that
it was all very vague
so many people are protesting
thank you
unfortunately they were successful
that is a good idea
where should it begin
that is not right
i prefer to look ahead
thank you very much  commissioner
the debate is closed

applause
how can these be reduced
this is absolutely vital
the first is external trade
the debate is closed

they do not exist
and what does this mean
applause
applause
thank you very much  commissioner
the debate is closed
what should we do
these issues are real issues
i agree with that praise
what is required
unfortunately  they are
it is essential
i very much regret this
thank you very much  commissioner
the debate is closed
that is our limit
subject  common patent system
subject  european constitution
is that the council's view
i shall spare him that

why was that
who knows
i therefore voted against them
are there any comments
we want peace
applause
applause
a startling figure
applause
firstly  enlargement
secondly  the lisbon strategy
no proof at all
that is scandalous
sittings come and go
so do programmes
an excellent move
cooperation is not enough
i wish you every success
we are deluding ourselves
that concludes the item
part i
president
that is not possible
de mining is also important
part ii
questions to commissioner liikanen
only in this case
how to produce more entrepreneurs
and
questions to commissioner patten
subject  status of kosovo
subject  voice of europe
proper safeguards will be needed
the debate is closed
let us just be honest
that is a welcome move
why
why
i have never believed that
let me make another comment
the debate is closed
what is the situation today
is this rhetoric or sentimentality
no
it is all very vague

we therefore voted against
no country is spared

2
conscientious objectors
it is the first step
but why
combat illegal immigration
we can move freely
security is no longer guaranteed
the questions are financial
the questions are also professional
votes cast   509
absolute majority   255
are there any comments
this is a mistake
the minutes were approved
there is glaring inequality
i hope i am wrong
why is that
these are a necessity
this is a linguistic question
thank you for your reply
thank you
the minister is right
what has to be done
you are greek
souda is in greece
subject  situation in chechnya
ebrd activities
why
that is not all
the balance sheet is impressive

no
the answer is no
the debate is closed
is this utopian thinking
we shall see
self help is better
aquaculture is not dangerous
i do not think so
stocks are continuing to decline

applause
laughter and applause
applause
applause
applause
why
war is not inevitable
it was very interesting
applause
calm down
applause
applause
what did we do
nobody
nobody intervened
so  let us stay calm
iran now possesses missiles
obviously not
that would be too dangerous
of course not
that would be too dangerous
that is the truth
so we have time
let us change the agenda
applause
iraq must pull itself together
what will europe propose
that is his opinion
what are we suggesting
the gap will grow
millions of refugees
that is the choice
there are many other proposals
applause
let america listen to her
no
thank you
and what are we doing
no
i do not think so
how can this be so
it is a veritable holocaust
the situation is very alarming
end of quote
the debate is closed
it is not working
this is not right
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
this is not true
the debate is closed
hunger cannot wait
in short  a success story
protectionism
take zimbabwe  for example
this makes sense
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
i vote against
joint motion for a resolution
it should not read 'demokratiekomittee'
that is an incorrect translation
hence my positive vote
that is surely right
these are the three characteristics
a free i raq '
iraq is rich in petroleum
we want to talk
we want to negotiate
and now  bon appétit
resumption of the session
are there any comments
wednesday
parliament agreed to the request
wonderful
that concludes the item
we need both
europe can make a difference
we must be bolder
it therefore represents hope
i shall cite three examples
the sea represents life itself
i am sorry
discussions have begun again
this is inadequate
necessity knows no law
what do we do then
this protection must be transparent
we have flexibility
that is not acceptable
i agree with this wholeheartedly
this is our request
this is a welcome proposal
others have spoken about this
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
written declaration  article 120
we must be prudent
immigration is only a possibility
the debate is closed
written declaration  rule 120
we congratulate the rapporteur
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
is that correct
hence my vote against
there are many other examples
quite the opposite
i am not sure
the debate is closed
they were an instrument
that may well be so
we are waiting  however
what is this about
that would also raise problems
the debate is closed
alright
now we must act
thank you  commissioner schreyer
is this correct
thank you  commissioner schreyer
thank you  commissioner schreyer
the debate is closed
part i
part ii
questions to commissioner solbes
questions to commissioner lamy
what can we do
we must therefore change this
questions to commissioner diamantopoulou
i have three supplementary questions
no  of course not
this is not a change
this would have two impacts
a supplementary question
we must be realistic  however
that is very disappointing
first  the agency
it is a sectoral approach
final point  pricing
fifthly  road safety
better late than never
this is a missed opportunity
that is important
it needs money
the debate is closed
the first models are ready
that is very important
thank you commissioner
turning now to 3g
that is democracy
let us not underestimate it
for two reasons
what happens
nothing
click again
what happens
nothing
what do we need
thank you commissioner
the joint debate is closed
applause
we need it
so what do we see
the answer is no
where is the evaluation
it does not
why am i worried
this affects the whole area
even more redundancies
this optimism is sorely needed
it is not simple
that was very difficult
so spot the mistake
why
item 66
item 79
amendment no 26
specialists are asking questions
for all
for absolutely everybody
i therefore voted against it
the sitting is suspended
applause
applause from the right  heckling
applause
applause
loud applause

applause
applause
that person is saddam hussein
peace for whom
for the oppressed iraqis

loud applause
that much is very clear
mr blix has confirmed that
the debate is closed
written declarations  rule 120
i do not understand
it is quite frightening
the criticism is justified
very good
that is wrong
the debate is closed
that was the first aspect
the subject speaks for itself
this is extremely serious
the facts are there
thank you  mr president
the debate is closed
firstly  comitology
why
the debate is closed
written declaration  rule 120
of them  one woman dies
that would be immoral
this is not trivial
it is all nonsense
the situation is very grave
this raises concerns
this raises huge concerns
the facts speak for themselves
applause from the left
i am pro choice
applause from the left
the commission welcomes them
i disagree
this is not a clarification
applause
the debate is closed
written declaration  rule 120
but that is not enough
this list is not exhaustive
nothing has happened
that is an obstacle
the debate is closed
decision on urgent procedure
i welcome this report
drug addiction is not tolerable
it is all complete nonsense
thank you  commissioner byrne
the debate is closed
that is crucial
why
the debate is closed
that concludes voting time
that is a good thing
we must respond to this
it goes back 25 years
who is responsible
who should pay
let us think about that
we entirely support it
we all know that
that is indeed the case
thank you  commissioner
that is not entirely satisfactory
thank you very much  commissioner
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
he is opposing the resolution
the debate is closed
resumption of the session
thank you  mr president
i would definitely welcome that
applause from the right
i take note of that
what are our objectives
another aspect is education
that is my first question
secondly  the mandate
finally  development
far from it
let us move ahead
not a single one
thank you  mr president
i oppose it
firstly  self handling
thank you  mr president
why
yes or no
absolutely nothing  ladies and gentlemen
it bears no relation
nobody
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
written declaration  article 120
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
please heed their call
we must acknowledge this
opening of the session

i welcome that
we want enlargement
the debate is closed
that is quite clear
applause
the debate is closed
mixed reactions
mixed reactions
loud applause
parliament adopted the resolution
parliament adopted the resolution

it is absolutely obvious
why
this is unacceptable
the debate is closed
there are various possibilities
it is not easy
the debate is closed
part i
i know all of this
that is the connection
part two
questions to mr fischler
have i understood that properly
let us continue with rice
how can we guarantee that
how can it be controlled
emu has been very successful
the convention  however  is silent
sweden has a well run economy
i believe not
and this is true
the debate is closed

they deserve our respect
applause
applause
applause
the debate is closed
written declaration  rule 120
why is this so
joint motion for a resolution
it should also be public
we voted against it
everything is a commodity
let it be taken up
that approach is unacceptable
are there any comments
he minutes were approved
our objectives are clear
i refuse to do that
the commission accepts this reprimand
these discussions are necessary
why are they necessary
are such transfers legal
and that is not all
how can this be
the international police
that is totally wrong
that would be absurd
what is at issue here
that is true
this is discrimination
please accept my apology
subject  guantanamo bay
subject  maritime transport
is this possible
subject  flags of convenience
i must stress this
i agree with the speaker
very possibly
subject  enlargement

it is a good procedure
who knows
thank you very much
my committee finds this unacceptable
this is unacceptable
applause
finally  i turn to eurostat
that is fundamental
that will be very welcome
we need people
the 2000 2006 programmes
what can we see happening
thank you
what have we done
i welcome this project
thank you  mr wynn
the debate is closed
end of quotation
all discrimination is banned
the answer is 'no'
that is the reality
we need to support alstom
we are not doing that
thank you mr cashman
the debate is closed
romanian society has grown up
the converse also applies
the debate is closed
it is a first step
this is dangerous
the debate is closed
thus far about the amendments
the debate is closed
what are our specific problems
the debate is closed
thank you  mr president
later she accepted it
were these two philosophies compatible
transparency is therefore essential
firstly  investor protection
the debate is closed
european constitution and igc
perhaps that is a contradiction
not a single vote
what do we see there
another blow against schuman
what does this amount to
that is not enough
it is quite simply splendid
there are dangers lurking
that is impossible
i wish you good luck
the debate is closed
written statement  rule 120
i voted against the directive
the stakes  however  are high
parliament rejects this
that concludes the vote
what should our strategy be
is this still possible
we must go further
it is exceedingly urgent
it is an armed intifada
what about israel
what can europe do
this was too much  however
the debate is closed
written statement  rule 120
where did we go wrong
could we have done more
so what was cancún about
how did this come about
why do i say that
then there is the g 21
what  then  went wrong
we have to move forward
all that is true
who was to blame
that would be a pity
which rules  though
this debate is dragging on
i also agree with it
however  they were scuppered
the debate is closed
that is simply not possible
fine words
this is an important area
that is a lot
the debate is closed
because the dates are crucial
that is the first pillar
the debate is closed
that mystifies me absolutely
this needs to be reviewed
some problems remain
what do you need
progress has definitely been made
we have engineered a revolution
the debate is closed
that is amendment no 11
the debate is closed
i was there
that is a good thing
we must not forget that
what have we been doing
welcome
the debate is closed
that is a shame
thank you very much  commissioner
the debate is closed
let me be clear
this is an opinion
it has not been proven
i will finish on this
what emerges from this
that is our only concern
what emerges from this
the debate is closed
joint motion for a resolution
the rest remains unchanged
they should be ashamed
why is that the case
that is the first issue
the debate is closed
some aspects clearly overlap
the debate is closed
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
parliament adopted the text
president
that concludes the vote
are there any comments
1
that concludes the item
there are two basic reasons
thank you very much
that concludes the item
this  in itself  is exceptional
that concludes the debate  1
why
well  nothing is being done
we are moving very slowly
this is a step
what can the other be
why not
we must take action
they are the victors
thank you  minister
the debate is closed
no agreement is perfect
what an absurd view
it is not true
we should lead by example
the joint debate is closed
the debate is closed
the market is changing
that much is clear
why
the debate is closed
thank you for that
the choice is not difficult
that much is true
any other consideration is secondary
this is not acceptable
it clearly is now
but that is not enough
the debate is closed
that is the bottom line
that has already become apparent
is there any hope
i wish you well  gentlemen
he cannot
think of haifa
we must believe in ourselves
they must restore public order
or justifiable
mr high representative
where is europe
why is europe paralysed
the picture is clear
we are politicians
i ask you that
we are supporting this too
they put up resistance
what are we doing
what is the eu doing
these people are our neighbours
thishas been noted mr gollnisch
the debate is closed
1
the results obtained are impressive
this is an important issue
1
2
it deserves some reflection
– thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
i think this is wrong
will we be closing beaches
– the debate is closed
– the debate is closed
what  then  is this about
– congratulations  mr lange
that is first rate
– the debate is closed
when will they reply
these are the facts
we have the capacities
we have the knowledge
is this wise overall
that seems less dangerous
the debate is closed
– the debate is closed
– the debate is closed
– the debate is closed
1
we are against
thank you  mr jarzembowski
modernisation is sorely needed
this variable is essential
not in my view
will this remain a dream
fantastic
awareness of languages;
2
parliament takes a different view
for this i thank him
that you know
firstly  iraq
thank you  mr president
i do not think so
something is clearly wrong
from latin america
from asia
from africa
from the mediterranean
quite the contrary
thank you very much
not one penny
that is not good enough
our accounting is consistent
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
this is completely unnecessary
i have confidence in this
why is it important
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
i do not think so
no  we cannot
that is my aim
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
this is my first request
this is an improvement
the debate is closed
1
what is involved
what precisely is involved
that is the difference
look at europe  this europe
they are cheapskate proposals
why are we concerned
that is the question
beware of rhetoric
the united states manage 3%
this is a tragic waste
has it been heeded
carry on
the debate is closed
i voted in favour
the amendments are
2
all the best
will it enjoy effective powers
i certainly hope so
the debate is closed
it is an important development
let us be clear
that concludes the debate
the risk of defeat
i doubt it
it is not negotiable
the debate is closed
that is my first question
this is the first sign
this is how things stand
let us protect the palestinians
the debate is closed
it is to be welcomed
the entrepreneur has invested capital
i know many of them
the debate is closed
i applaud this proposal
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
that is very serious
so who is right
the question is how
the debate is closed
1
2
3
4
that concludes the votes  5
i voted in favour
hence my vote in favour
that is quite nonsensical
6
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
what did the commission do
i digress
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
i will begin with tobacco
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
that leaves kyrgyzstan
the joint debate is closed  1
that concludes the vote
they are very welcome
thank you
our direct intervention is needed
we have a hostage here
that concludes the item
thank you very much
they are very welcome
the reason is clear
the results were very interesting
i would like an answer
my sincere congratulations on this
this is an important point
i have three questions
that is the current situation
thank you
that concludes the item
it is not too early
firstly  qualified majority voting
all the positions are known
the citizens
they are the sole legislators
another step forward  euratom
i could go on
the attacks are fierce
this is not the way
that is the way
is it estonia’s fault
poland’s
that is technically possible
frankly  that is unacceptable
that is definitely unacceptable
that concludes the debate
they are the water carriers
why a simple regulation
why a single regulation
i could not agree more
the debate is closed
what are those realities
that is the problem
the joint debate is closed
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
it is disappointing
really disappointing
the debate is closed
that seems to be working
that is quite clear
matters cannot continue like this
the debate is closed
that was the big problem
that is our first question
our second priority is employment
i agree with that
that is vitally important
finally  a word of warning
the debate is closed
who determines the laws
who personifies public power
the answer is  none
the debate is closed
that concludes the vote
can anyone take this seriously
1
this is extremely odd
it is very obvious
you mentioned transport
what do we see
they bring the courage
i have spoken about legislation
he lost
that time is now
that is the crucial question
why  however
yes to research
why the dates
under what conditions
you were already unique
that is significantly fewer
that is consistent
what is to be done
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
i strongly support their flexibility
we do not know
we therefore support these projects
why do we do this
this position is unacceptable
that is european innovation
i have a few comments
the debate is closed
but you cannot explain
thank you  commissioner bolkestein
the debate is closed
1
1
that is still my objective
we all are
no  apparently not
we want to see results
the culture must be changed
lastly  the question of eurostat
you bear full responsibility
who will obtain them
step down
when did they occur
are they still going on
that is necessary
that is wrong
we are not involved
further reform is needed
the objective remains unfixed
what planet is he on
why do i welcome it
how can it do this
that must change
that must change too
we must act now
that is your problem
that concludes the item
that amendment has now disappeared
are there any comments
thank you  mr patakis
that is not correct
nonetheless  are there no concerns
are there no questions
there are
– the debate is closed
far from it
this is very unfortunate
this is the twenty first century
perhaps some people want that
we reject this directive
we are opposed to it
the reverse is true
i would have no objection
it is not
subject  reconstruction of iraq
– i agree with you
we all know that
the figures speak for themselves
screening means diagnosis
– thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
international cooperation will be indispensable
i welcome that
what was it about
efficiency – what efficiency
speed is of the essence
the debate is closed
– thank you commissioner
the debate is closed
– the debate is closed
– the debate is closed
congratulations  mr adam
where is it traceable to
this is the people talking
the debate is closed
that is not the case
that would clearly be foolish
well
should we rejoice at this
what is this all about
that is unacceptable
that is all very well
development cooperation
could you clarify the situation
1
i voted in favour
i voted in favour
these  therefore  are the reasons
i do not think so
why are matters like this
that is extremely important
what has happened since then
the debate is closed
europe has changed
why not georgia
i understand his fears
that is the issue
enlargement will have a limit
the debate is closed
that is quite impossible
the debate is closed
everybody seems to acknowledge this
the position cannot change
my supplementary question
5
that is good news
this is completely unacceptable
it is a good question
dassault is selling the rafale
we must be honest
the debate is closed
in conclusion  the final topic
firstly  financial assistance
things could get even better
my congratulations to mr lagendijk
within the next two years
thank you  mr howitt
the debate is closed
thank you  mrs stenzel
the debate is closed
no  it is something else
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
we must deliver such action
thank you  mr watson
the debate is closed  1
the formal sitting is closed
this is regrettable
why
we want to ensure quality
the correct one
1
2
3
i voted in favour
this warrants my full support
hence my vote against
i therefore voted in favour
it is unacceptable
4
they are not in jeopardy
yes
yes
yes
yes
that is questionable
the debate is closed
this has to stop
he is right
we do not understand
are there any comments
1
that is the situation
overall openness will diminish
no comment
this is the picture
bravo
bravo
time is marching on
malta will have five
do not do that
i was not heeded
my appeal was neglected
what a pity
i welcome that
do you never learn
the eu faces huge tasks
that is wholly unacceptable
what could be fairer
there was deadlock
why would that be
no
this argument is utterly false
what about portugal
what is happening with ireland
are they any different
this is extremely serious
why is it so serious
we also need acts
the pact is too rigid
the law must be respected
let us bury this pact
that is not acceptable
this is very serious
dual standards
that was the real tragedy
how very simple
thank you
the substance is the same
there was total compliance
the debate is closed
'europe begins in the regions'
all these things matter
this phase has already begun
that is our disease
the reality is rather different
we are aware of this
it is unacceptable
we cannot tolerate this
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
they were given no help
accept the challenge
the goodwill is there
i am deeply saddened
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
that is the standard rate
the debate is closed
enlargement is one example
that is how things stand
that is the problem
the debate is closed
this will become simpler
this is hopelessly complicated
wonderful
–that concludes the debate
1
–that concludes the vote
this is simply unacceptable
this will lead to chaos
the deadlines were abysmal
i was opposed to it
so be it
who are these people
who are these people
the debate is closed
there is more
what is happening now
that is absolutely fundamental
there must be certain rights
there is no choice
– thank you  mr president
the debate is closed
the complications are now evident
what is this all about
the debate is closed
i hope they go through
that is essential
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
1
1
we have 95%
that is not the case
what can be done
nobody was against it
no
ask the people
this is no great tragedy
they need modernising
i very much regret that
long live the constitution
everyone has granted me that
if only
1
at last we have succeeded
have a nice lunch
1
thank you and
thank you  mr fatuzzo
2
would that be possible
section i european parliament
section ii – council
section iii – commission
section iv court of justice
section v court of auditors
section viii a  european ombudsman
my thanks for this
it is an historic budget
terrific
about time  too
everyone deserves credit
and for what
it most definitely is not
what does ecofin consist of
what does it do
we are already unpopular
we greatly appreciate this
the debate is closed
– no
are they economic difficulties
i therefore await clarification
i understood perfectly
innovations come at a price
third  the environmental aspects
finally  information to patients
that is a good thing
all this is very positive
i am still sceptical
that is an omission
we have missed an opportunity
why such generosity
i object
that is very important
i take a different view
surely
when will you ever learn
but we have that problem
you must be flexible
permanent derogations are exceptional
we must support innovation
i am always polite
it is a political position
they are important
i will make myself clear
mrs oomen ruijten  please
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
i also use garlic
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
we worked well together
i doubt it very much
the debate is closed
why
why
the third is national taxation
so what is this about
the debate is closed  1
the debate is closed
that would be terrible
but of course
terrific
the debate is closed
1
2
3
that concludes the vote
i regard that as unacceptable
it is not acceptable
this would be totally incomprehensible
it is not acceptable
that was a milestone
shame on them
this would be irresponsible
4
why is this so
this new technology is fantastic
i thank the honourable member
this requires modern technology
they are necessary
this is only reasonable
that is crucial
the debate is closed
my group will endorse it
nobody wants it
is that really your intention
but then it disappeared again
that is my position
that is a
of course we can
what should the solution be
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
i hope that will end
the debate is closed
the situation is unacceptable
you know that  of course
i shall continue in french
that is my first question
perhaps ups flies to athens
that is another story  however
it means christmas holiday package
that concludes the debate
that concludes the debate
it is completely unacceptable
that concludes the debate
he mentioned organic farming
how does the consumer react
that concludes the debate
that concludes the debate
1
1
the debate is closed
why not
let us be logical
that cannot work
the debate is closed
1
we are now voting
2
3
that concludes the vote
so be it
we reject this idea
this is incomprehensible and derisory
surely not
quite the opposite
i support this change
the plenary has spoken
4
but for how long
what is to be done
who will pay
from which budget
the debate is closed
i enjoyed that
this has to stop
this really has to stop
the joint debate is closed
the joint debate is closed
1
does the house agree
where are we now
let us be careful
thank you very much  commissioner
the debate is closed
a year has now passed
it was frustrating on occasions
this is no coincidence
europe must act
today  let us be clear
that would be unacceptable
once again
this directive must be applied
i most certainly am not
thank you very much  commissioner
the debate is closed
i never said so
the objective must be pursued
think again  commissioner
that is vitally important
the first concerns waste
that attitude beggars belief
thank you  commissioner
after that  we shall conclude
the debate is closed
that is not acceptable
i think that is right
the debate is closed
1
my group cannot accept it
i am a little unsure
numerous paragraphs are contradictory
the debate is closed
that was a tragedy
why
the second principle is supervision
the debate is closed
you received that communication
it is clear
that is the good news
they want social power
my first relates to agriculture
how is that possible
that is my first point
prevention is better than cure
i therefore voted in favour
i therefore voted in favour
the singapore issues
i think not
agriculture
how right he is
not at all
we reformed
the debate is closed
this results in overexploitation
resources are obviously required
it is insufficiently precise
we should respect that
the debate is closed
i do not think so
– thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
thank you very much
– thank you  mr varela
i thoroughly endorse that analysis
thank you for this decision
what would the consequences be
that is very bad
the debate is closed
i have accepted these arguments
the debate is closed
that is very important
a second point is research
that is incredible
what are they doing
how much are they contributing
what chance do they have
he is brilliant
the rich oppose it
it means sharing
the debate is closed
this is therefore moving forward
africa is not for sale
he has to get tough
this work is continuing
it is very ambitious
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
1
1
that is the priority
what has happened so far
this must change
this must change
this must change
this must change
either
equality all round
thank you
that is the reality
it is time we acted
unemployment is rising
that is all very well
there are too many stakeholders
the facts are simple
unfortunately  this is true
we need a joint effort
that concludes the debate
i will do that
bono will be pleased
well  life is like that
that is how it is
well  you should
that concludes the vote
we abstained
it is deplorable
i voted against
1
we have some amazing statistics
it is a vital issue
everybody who wants to come
i think that is impossible
thank you
who contributes the ideas
are the national parliaments consulted
that is not true
thank you  mrs sartori
the debate is closed
that is the key issue
discussions are ongoing
who do they report to
is there somebody in charge
how is it organised
who is in charge
this is a new departure
good luck  sir
it is a complex issue
we are aware of that
this ambivalence cannot continue
the debate is closed
i want to emphasise that
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
well  we are still waiting
why may we do so
are we certain of that
i thank parliament
the debate is closed
1
1
we are grateful to them
that is premature
they should also be clarified
i agree with that
that should be clarified
he believes in the market
that is very regrettable
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
1
i voted in favour
i voted in favour
subsidiarity must apply
i therefore voted against
this explains our vote
what hypocrisy
i am very concerned
2
so far  so good
thank you in advance
quite the reverse
the debate is closed
that would be too much
the joint debate is closed
we should honour his memory
the joint debate is closed
thank you  commissioner vitorino
1
why
that is an important point
we need referenda
it is not possible
they are not a secret
that is essential
that would cause a stir
how
a norwegian  please note
that concludes the debate
the vote will be tomorrow
that concludes the item
that is your expression
that concludes the debate
the vote will be tomorrow
and
i have met the operators
the result is satisfactory
that concludes the debate
and
this is quite remarkable
but why is this
the debate is closed
thank you  mr bösch
the debate is closed
let me go through them
that is a clear alternative
action is needed
the debate is closed
the third point concerns enlargement
it requires in depth analysis
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
it is not enough  however
excellent
1
this is irresponsible
i voted in favour
it is completely unacceptable
that concludes the vote  2
the message is clear
or is it
1
we must be realistic
what is this actually about
what role should redistribution have
they are european initiatives
the debate is closed
my proposals are also clear
it is a horrendous precedent
but this was unusual
that is a personal experience
good
that is the first point
why stop here
that concludes the debate
that concludes the debate
and
secondly  there is social policy
that concludes the debate
1
1
he briefly mentioned that
oh really
we are always  acting
that is a mistake
let us protect them
have we done enough research
is this true or not
thank you very much
why is this so  commissioner
what do the consumers want
use vaccines
how effective are they
this matter is under review
they are being financed
the debate is closed
that is sensible
thank you
the debate is closed
that is not on
i thank you
that has been decided upon
protection remains necessary
thank you mrs lulling
1
this word replaces 'authority'
the rest remains unchanged
– very well  mr katiforis
i voted in favour
and
this explains our vote
1
what are the possible solutions
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
thank you
something has to be done
that is a scientific issue
thank you  commissioner
why is this the case
farewell cohesion
farewell solidarity
the timeframes are extremely long
the debate is closed
nothing of the sort
will the commission provide information
thank you
thank you
that is the first answer
this situation is unacceptable
they are
these are not very helpful
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
will they grasp the challenge
we believe in social capitalism
how  though
not one word
yes  but about what
you bet
what  then  is the cure
europe is a common venture
the debate is closed
i will deal with it
that concludes the vote
thank you mr fatuzzo
we therefore abstained
1
help us ’
that can be legally established
what did we do
i think it is shameful
what does that really mean
do not forget that
i think not
the debate is closed
such arrangements are untenable
nothing less
they were already forbidden
unfortunately  they were all false
i agree
the debate is closed
1
what is the situation today
we wanted 20%
the first concerns drugs
the debate is closed
this is an innovation
we welcome that
this debate will continue
we are far from it
our message must be clear
the debate is closed
i voted in favour
the sitting is resumed
are there any comments
so here are my questions
so much the better
you talked about confusion
where is the confusion
where is transparency
where is democracy
that is the content
you talk about exemptions
the debate is closed
it is a legitimate question
yes or no
the debate is closed
we share their view
why
the joint debate is closed
i strongly condemn that assassination
thank you  mr patten
the joint debate is closed
this is a terrible situation
shortly
thank you  commissioner
1
may i request that correction
2
3
we need to restore growth
that stands to reason
that is just too bad
that concludes the debate
but what is actually happening
can we stop now
i do not think so
that is not enough
we need to go further
nothing has happened
how does europe respond
but where is the cash
it is no solution
and why not
but that is not all
fine
unfortunately this is not possible
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
this is a complicated matter
i am very pleased
ireland has yet to ratify
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
1
why
the war has become self perpetuating
but which russia
we all know why
it is something far worse
we see other things
these conditions have been met
the debate is closed
nothing has been done
are there any comments
1
– thank you mr president
it is totally unacceptable
and
what are we celebrating
what is a family
they should be welcomed
i believe it is necessary
that is scandalous beyond belief
finland’s
sweden’s
first  a few facts
the debate is closed
it considerably simplifies matters
the debate is closed
it is very important
that is unacceptable
the facts are inescapable
their citizens deserve it
thank you  mr coelho
the debate is closed
why is this so
this is severely disappointing
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
we think they are important
who decides that
these cases are well founded
that is not the case
i welcome this proposal
thank you  mr dehousse
the debate is closed
those who tinker lose customers
the institutions have come together
the debate is closed
why was there this disparity
far from a bargain
why so
they may be right
so much for the form
why all this
the debate is closed
we are looking at outcomes
that is my suggestion
anything else would be absurd
it seems not
those against please
are there any abstentions
what will this lead to
why ruin them
the debate is closed
i find this outrageous
that concludes the vote
i voted against
this situation must be stopped
thank you  mr turmes
this  however  is the theory
we say no
i voted in favour
i voted against
are there any comments
that will be corrected  1
what of their families
what of their concerns
what of their human rights
the debate is closed
it is not easy
this is  however  necessary
the debate is closed
what is a good teacher
it is done
europe has a soul
the second field is culture
over what period
on what basis
what news
that is clear
the debate is closed
it will focus on children
it is horrific
it is not acceptable
for the weak  unattainable
but for the brave  opportunity
how far have we got
five months
what issues
raised by whom
we do not know
what does it do
he is right
again  they are right
that is true
the debate is closed
and
the turnaround is truly remarkable
the situation has changed  however
this is not so
there is still time
we had to do it
we are making preparations
this difference is crucial
one final remark
corruption undermines economic progress
we completely condemn these articles
together we can strengthen europe
another problem is cyprus
that concludes the vote
1
that was not my aim
that concludes the joint debate
this is not correct
the debate is closed
there has not
i know that
that has not happened
he is correct in that
the irish government welcomes that
2
and
europe has a soul
thank you for this report
railtrack by sea
he is very wise
the debate is closed
just four topics
for whom
a speculative one
they need different rules
the industry approves
they are the big losers
we want to defend consumers
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
1
no more bombs
no more deaths
that is extremely depressing
on the contrary
that is my personal view
it is a real problem
thank you  mrs lynne
things can get worse still
the debate is closed
1
we have plenty of time
it is only a recommendation
paragraph 33 is poor
that concludes the vote
thank you  mrs oomen ruijten
i voted for the report
i voted in favour
sovereignty must be safeguarded
i voted in favour
thank you  mr ford
what can be done
the situation reflects this
let us remember these events
the joint debate is closed
quite the opposite
the joint debate is closed
no
the joint debate is closed

1
– thank you  mrs banotti  1
– i can do that
and
that is clear
this appears unlikely
congratulations to mr skinner
the joint debate is closed
that is the first choice
but what shall we do
let us be realistic
how could he get justice
what happens to them
they do not work
that is perfectly true
the debate is closed
an explanation really is needed
what was their final destination
i will reiterate that point
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
by all means  commissioner
the debate is closed

these new agreements are ambitious
two very different approaches
what is it all about
i believe this is right
i do not believe so
what is it all about
it has been tough
i cannot support that
what is it about
the joint debate is closed
this must be stopped
the reality is different
that is cruel
i consider that unacceptable
this is an important issue
what does ‘special’ mean
one last thing
refrigeration permits this
this should stop
what do we want
why increase spaces
in order to increase costs
whom does this benefit
what is the justification
no  it is not
nine hours is about right
the debate is closed
– that concludes the vote
i voted in favour
i voted in favour
2
and what are the circumstances
that is true
why all these words
why no action
politically  we do nothing  however
this debate is outdated
it is a democracy
do we mourn this man
the fight against terrorism
resolution of the conflict
lastly  democratic reforms
where is the balance
what are we doing now
politics are not neutral
it must be condemned
the debate is closed
what are the priorities now
that is completely unacceptable
let us remind ourselves
we must change policy
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the commission supports these efforts
i hope we succeed
that has been postponed
it makes sense
that is a serious omission
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
i do not agree
that is just one reflection
that is incorrect
the joint debate is closed
what is happening
only four
that is the reality
we endorse the joint text
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
2
1
this will not be easy
europe is now to act
we support you
that is not sustainable
the constitution
why now
adieu  giscard d'estaing
how true
this would be very serious
further political measures are required
is this reasonable
i could not agree more
the joint debate is closed
these irregularities must be addressed
1
that was foolish
are the problems already resolved
the debate is closed
this is the fourth report
victimisation is also prohibited
muslims are being persecuted
ladies and gentlemen
the debate is closed
they merit some detailed consideration
the debate is closed
have you read it
it is an astonishing debate
–thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed  1
that cannot be changed
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
this is quite unacceptable
is it really effective
but no
requirements that are unjust
the debate is closed
why direct access
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
thirdly  introducing transparency
the edf covers five years
how
everyone knows this dossier well
the debate is closed
that was not bad
the debate is closed
that is what we have
the debate is closed
many thanks  madam vice president
all these things take time
surely not
what about the structural funds
this is a positive step
just as well
that is not our idea
long live freedom
long live the european union
and why are we small
let us look at demography
the debate is closed
1
this is my sincere hope
i therefore voted in favour
i voted in favour
i voted in favour
we voted against it
item 28
item 147
what a charade
i voted in favour
that concludes the vote  4
5
the debate is closed
this development will continue
1
are there any comments  1
2
no  this is not on
the debate is closed
and
firstly  joint and several liability
the joint debate is closed
this proposal has several objectives
this is very important
the debate is closed
– the debate is closed
that is our main purpose
the debate is closed
i shall be brief
firstly  investment incentives
thirdly  comitology
so much for the background
this has been most important
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
this is an innovative concept
why
this is a positive move
the debate is closed
i will list nine points
i can see why
first of all  russia
these are the arguments
thank you  commissioner wallström
the debate is closed
lastly  the timescale
it all seems ridiculous
those are our main arguments
the debate is closed
i regret that
the debate is closed
that is progress
that is progress
however  that is not all
the debate is closed
1
1
summer is coming
these are good guidelines
i thank you all
many thanks
that is a fair objective
firstly  the european coastguards
the debate is closed
this has not been possible
that cannot be right
who pays for this
the debate is closed
that will need to change
the debate is closed
good controls are essential
thank you for your collaboration
the debate is closed
this is that moment
that is the first point
that is the first thing
very good
rapporteur  what is your opinion
i therefore endorse the report
decision time is approaching
1
i hope it does
the debate is closed
islands have to be helped
solidarity is called for
we have argued this strongly
thank you  mr president
that is quite simply untrue
there will be more money
the debate is closed
the debate is closed;
the debate is closed
section ii – council
section viii – ombudsman
both are essential
we must wait until 2005
we now have twelve agencies
the second question concerns strasbourg
i have two concrete questions
that concludes the item
thank you  commissioner
its conclusions are positive
that work is under way
that will be the case
what are these amendments
do you agree
could this be possible
mr paasilinna is unhappy
today this partnership works
that is one case
1
that is my first point
let me be quite clear
it is a difficult time
we understand that
we understand the history
let me explain why
that is impossible to achieve
that is the difference
who with
under whose auspices
with what international support
the opposite is the case
'yes' took courage
this is an historic plan
what is our response
i believe in miracles
that is unacceptable
he was too polite
let us call for that
they could not
the debate is closed
so be it
this must also be clarified
there is nothing else available
that is not the case
the debate is closed
he was talking about cyprus
that is the important point
first of all  hiv/aids
we will continue our work
let us stop this  please
it is not acceptable
thank you
we have 338 amendments
that is my proposal
you have 350
– i am surprised
please calm down
they are no longer relevant
it is also 2 10 p m
of course  i voted against
i voted in favour
this deserves my support
naturally  i voted in favour
i voted in favour
it is a disgrace
1
i share this view
some have been quoted
the debate is closed
pakistan is among them
the debate is closed
this is a mixed picture
second topic  terrorism
third topic  reproductive health
shame on them
is this genuine
they have intrinsic value
i wish him well
the debate is closed
is he proud of that
this is well known
however  we have to try
the debate is closed
that is my prediction
i am a german mep
the jury protested
the same applies to liverpool
the debate is closed
what is the proposal
this modification is also acceptable
the debate is closed
i do not think so
that is the decisive point
you could call it nepotism
the debate is closed
we would like the opposite
i will not elaborate further
the future is bright
the debate is closed
1
he has served his sentence
this is not before time
two examples
this cannot continue
the verdict is identical
the debate is closed
thank you
it has done so already
companies do not want them
this needs to be increased
this scenario did not work
thank you  mrs randzio plath
how can investment be encouraged
two ways are possible
failure is inevitable
national policies differ
it needs to be said
we do not want that
where do our opportunities lie
the debate is closed
1
so there it is
1
no
no
no
no
i will be brief
i wish you well
2
that concludes the vote
hence my vote
consequently  i voted in favour
naturally  i voted in favour
procedures are important
this is understandable
i voted against the report
this is not all  however
4
i have mixed feelings though
what are they doing
that is the current situation
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
it is therefore correct
this is not the case
we regret the current situation
what should be done
thank you  mr rübig
2
this situation must stop
that dream has become reality
we should congratulate them all
let us rejoice in that
europe is being reborn
why
that is true
mr president
it counts
are there any comments
i am an austrian
i replied  'absolutely necessary
are there any comments
that day is upon us
the baby was important
many people were not impressed
fare well  europe
this is what europe was
that concludes the debate
the answer is certainly 'yes'
see you soon
that is a shame
liberal democracy has triumphed
we need a constitution
we actively contributed our views
cooperation means coercion
more is the pity
what are these foundations
an institutional balance is required
an accommodation is called for
our citizens want more europe
much remains to be done
– the debate is closed
that concludes the vote
explanations of vote
my masters  are we mad
1
we should remember their sacrifice
that must be our priority
enlargement  however  is continuing
this is too few
that is just not logical
where does europe end
now everything depends on us
the conditions were as follows
this is where we are
the challenge is still there
the debate is closed
what  though  is the reality
production is decreasing
i very much regret that
it must survive
our common market has grown
we do not agree
i am optimistic
the debate is closed
freedom  security and justice
i reject that
even a temporary restriction
this is not acceptable
this includes turkey
thank you so much
the debate is now closed
1
1
thank you mr perry
thank you very much
thank you
good luck
such a europe will survive
this is the main problem
that is europe for you
africa is our responsibility
europe has 800 million inhabitants
it shares our cultural heritage
that concludes the item
it is a disgrace
i thank my cabinet
next week
this is my last wish
thank you
this report has been prepared
thank you very much

1
he has not changed
that is not on
that is a pity
thank you  mr president
thank you
we will see decisive improvements
we have agreed a constitution
this is our true strength
see you in september
what is to be done
europe must be more visible
i really mean this
we cannot agree to it
thank you
thank you very much
the debate is suspended
mr james nicholson
mrs godelieve quisthoudt rowohl
mrs mia de vits
mrs genowefa grabowska
mrs anneli jäätteenmaki
mrs astrid lulling
why
there is no rush
we wish you much luck
secondly  the lisbon objective
europe needs this
that is the question
you are aware of this
freedom  solidarity and respect
the debate is closed
1
1
this is a momentous event
that is our first question
good luck
this is europe’s identity
believe me
we will not support it
the first concerns information
thank you
how might we achieve that
that is the reality
we have our own identity
what has it become today
it marks
2
the fourth question was
let me put a question
i love you
just look at the commission
we saw the eurostat scandal
that is all
i jest not
it is a restrained request
that regulation has not worked
how
we are addressing that
the debate is closed
why is that so
the debate is closed
secondly  i am a euro sceptic
the debate is closed
1
no analysis equates to justification
who shall speak for you
thank you mr president
thank you for your attention
these are our friends
freedom of expression is minimal
pharisees and hypocrites
this is a paradox
it is our duty
the debate is closed
there is no alternative
well  this is possible
no
no  it is not
europe alone is not enough
the brain drain
the debate is closed
1
i do not think so
good afternoon  ladies and gentlemen
the debate is closed
that concludes the debate
nevertheless  we have taken action
that is the question
could you give any examples
this will  therefore  change everything
thank you  commissioner
that is the reality
that is not enough  however
what has happened
it is encouraging
this is a must
it demands immediate action
this needs to be supported
we need to do more
the debate is closed
who were those involved
that is true
so should we
nothing
why is this so
what happened
what has come to pass
think about it  mr bot
that is not easy
when will it end however
that is a dead end
what is to be done
those are the undeniable facts
the debate is closed
first of all  police training
resolution 1546 provides for this
how could i
all done and dusted then
sighs of relief all round
it is a possibility
what is nato doing
that concludes the voting
–the debate is closed
are there any comments
how can this be done
there is a trade off here
there is only ‘either/or’
the reality is rather different
i wish you good luck
that would be a mistake
with both things
does this require a debate
the debate is closed
to the council
to the commission
how can it be harmful
these procedures are national
that is up to them
thank you very much
it is in our interests
the constitution is alive
why
this is unacceptable
you gave no reply
moreover  the means are there
that concludes question time
2
why is this so
no
no
it is also offensive
this is ridiculous
this is ridiculous
should we have them arrested
should we close the borders
it is about choice
i am very sad
i thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
i agree with its recommendations
we are the dominant species
why
that is my first question
the debate is closed
1
2
3
fortunately they were rejected
4
the joint debate is closed
thank you
why
the joint debate is closed
we have let it be
where does the money go
then we can talk
this is an outright disgrace
the joint debate is closed
1
2
3
emphatically  no
why
the debate is closed
how can we stop it
it has been impossible
everybody knows this
the first is security
this policy must be rationalised
something had to happen
occupying
what can we do
double standards
ineffectiveness
the palestinians are still waiting
how long must they wait
we will not forget you
it is working very well
here we are
we are friends of georgia
it went very well
thank you
thank you
the latter is crucial
thank you very much
anti discrimination
let us look at effectiveness
what happens now  though
mr donner has the floor
so i need to go
thank you very much
thank you
i thank you
what are they waiting for
what has got to happen
this situation can change
this is the tragic paradox
this is depressing
but that is not working
thank you very much
thank you very much
the debate is closed
thank you very much
1
1
why
which conventions would this involve
why more generous
where will the threshold lie
why one year earlier
thank you
she is right
this is obviously an exaggeration
thank you  mr lamy
should children use them
1
they all have their names
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed 1
2
3
i thank you
1
are there any comments
thank you for your attention
never again ’
i thank you
i shall do so
i have received 22 requests
mr president  thank you
obviously not
why are we not growing
that concludes the debate
fear is in the air
the workers must be involved
it is a competitive market
we need to work together
the debate is closed
their rights must be defended
it is a sad picture
the debate is closed
1
what are our values
that is a significant hurdle
that is a hurdle
the elephant is justus lipsius
first mistake
no  they were not
the council nominated you
try to tread carefully
thank you
you did the right thing
– thank you  mr president
we cannot accept this
we cannot support it
i apologise to mr buttiglione
that is unacceptable
mr buttiglione
i wish you good luck
i still have my doubts
and why
good luck  mr barroso
i thank you
so what are our reasons
you are mistaken
you are mistaken
thank you
is this a positive message
– thank you
it is not possible
– the debate is closed
– that concludes the vote
you deserve thanks for that
that is clear
this has to change
it is very simple
what a great development
congratulations on this achievement
why is this so
a change is therefore needed
that is just not on
my group backs these proposals
i thank you
thank you  mr president
thank you
all of that costs money
thank you  mr president
i thank you
many thanks
we should reject this budget
absolutely nothing
thank you very much
thank you  mrs xenogiannakopoulou
i thank you
that is unfortunate
how is this possible
thank you  madam president
thank you  commissioner
thank you
that is surely absurd
this is not an option
i much appreciate that
i appreciate that
thank you  commissioner
i wish him well
thank you  mr crowley
four subjects will be discussed
this now has to change
the choice is yours
not many
not enough
i thank you
i thank you
it certainly does not
the third issue is tampere
which priorities would this involve
i thank you
these figures are appalling
what nonsense
i renew that commitment today
you can count on me
thank you  mr barroso
mr schulz has the floor
is a strong european commission
this is intolerable
our strength is your strength
work fast
wonderful  do it  do it
many thanks
thank you very much
this point is important
it is a pluralist commission
that much is obvious
are there any comments
are there no more comments
we want to maintain that
this appears highly improbable
the debate is closed
and that i deeply regret
i thank you
many thanks
many thanks
no
what action should be taken
i thank you
the debate is closed
the problems are accumulating
i have two questions
thank you
mr president  thank you
thank you for your answer
question time is closed
1
on the contrary
who cares
the debate is closed
they will not work
the debate is closed
are there any objections
1
2
our message must be clear
that is our europe
thank you very much
where is the problem
the debate is closed
do they meet the requirements
i shall explain
thank you very much
we are not financing intransigence
the money will be wasted
they are our compatriots
that is our objective
that would not be sensible
failure is relative
it is so important
the debate is therefore closed
this is not the time
thank you
firstly the dates
the debate is closed
castro continues to be intractable
that would be very unfortunate
his word is law
just ask the opposition
i thank you
amnesty first  and then dialogue
we need to be honest
that is a fact
what is europe’s objective
the answer is simple  nothing
what about spain
i do not think so
the debate is closed
first of all  iraq
what is this about
i doubt it
i thank you
that is not all  however
we must improve our methodology
finally  lisbon
the goal is clear
this task is not easy
why
thank you
the netherlands is learning
everyone has signed it
is that it then
this is promising
thank you
thank you very much
is that true
we can do better
thank you  and good luck
thank you  mr nielson
not one
it is underdeveloped
parliament appreciates his presence
1
naturally  we are against
2
that concludes the vote
i voted in favour
i therefore voted in favour
i voted in favour
hence our vote
i voted in favour
i'll be supporting this report
i voted in favour
how
thank you very much
let me add two comments
this is a better commission
that is not enough
that is much worse
good luck
thank you very much
you will have noticed that
admittedly  we have regrets
no  apparently not
they are a joke
i do not think so
oh
why is this so
europe deserves a strong commission
thank you
good luck  mr durão barroso
thank you very much
we look forward to tomorrow
no
there is  therefore  a mechanism
they will be difficult years
thank you very much
however  i understand the remarks
that concludes question time
europe is changing
i will be very brief
the debate is closed
1
point 5  h
people understand that
it makes this institution stronger
thank you  mr president
thank you  mr president
thank you very much

3
i thank you
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
this is an untruth
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
dialogue has broken down
so what is being done
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
1
2
3
the potential is there
i believe that we have
today we are all ukrainians
our duty is to act
we should envisage two scenarios
we should move beyond rhetoric
yes  there is
good luck
it is our duty
mr yushchenko has rejected it
ukrainians are demanding their rights
it is our mission
they are universal
it is a historic moment
that too is good
the debate is closed
a genuine dialogue
that is only fair
such is not the case
thank you
i do not think so
some are  some are not
the debate is closed
we have nothing to hide
that is unacceptable
we know the reasons
thank you
the council got it wrong
the debate is therefore closed
and so it goes on
the figures speak for themselves
so who are those women
not at all
such thoughtlessness is lethal
these are alarming figures
they are volunteers
this is undoubtedly correct
let us not forget that
the debate is closed
i am so sorry  colleagues
that concludes the debate
it has to be protected
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the sitting is open
[thank you very much]
thank you
what are the criteria
was it useful
that is incredibly high
it all sounds too familiar
it goes on and on
it is a scandal
the system should be better
well that is quite understandable
that i can also understand
those assumptions have changed dramatically
– the debate is closed
the debate is closed
1
2
thank you
hence our vote against
– keep everyone on file
situation in ukraine
i will be voting accordingly
financial perspectives  b6 0189/2004
this situation cannot continue
that concludes the speeches
i welcome this
let me be quite clear
are our institutions ready
what is the financial position
where is the financial perspective
turkey is changing fast
what is turkey
it fell
do not commit it
thank you
the eu must also change
that is not the case
that is extortion
to close
thank you very much
the counter arguments are illogical
why
let there be no misunderstanding
i personally hope
turkey
this is a legitimate concern
what timescale would he recommend
i fully agree with this
–the debate is closed
europass is this initiative
thank you very much
– the debate is closed
why is that so important
what are our means
it is not a fortress
europe cannot be selfish
this is an appalling plan
the main obstacle is sharon
that is not the case
thank you
what is sustainable development
the debate is closed
you have the floor
there was direct censorship
this was absurd
that concludes the vote
i therefore voted in favour
i voted in favour
i voted in favour
i voted in favour
so far  so good
i thank you for that
we await parliament's views
thank you in advance
that is indeed so
on the structural funds
a little bit everywhere
it pays for this parliament
sk  thank you
thank you
tell me
no
were they consulted
no
no
the debate is closed
the answer is yes
that is fine with me
equal shares
thank you  commissioner
that is your opinion
thank you  madam president
thank you  commissioner
thank you very much
the debate is therefore closed
the debate is open
mrs lambert has the floor
it gives hope
this is entirely appropriate
thank you very much
the debate is therefore closed
it is effective
what is its objective
should we provide information
that is a risk
i will leave it here
emphatically not
thank you very much
that is fine  of course
that is extremely important
this is extremely important legislation
thank you very much
let us be clear
can you just be quiet
it is a scandal
romania will be accepted
i acknowledge that
it is scandalous
that is not democracy
that is wrong
persevere
will you apply zero tolerance
is that right
is it responsible
no  it is not
that is true
that is my first point
the debate is closed
the debate  mr president …
better late than never
that concludes the vote
explanations of vote
the eu must also change
hence our vote in favour
the sitting is suspended
this situation must change
that is true
i really welcome its conclusions
the debate is closed
all the chapters are closed
of course not
i take a different view
the debate is closed
i agree
that is an important point
you will always be welcome
why
there is thematic programming here
the debate is closed
increasing the number of volunteers
new problems require new solutions
in conclusion
the debate is closed
this is extremely important
progress has been made
there is no disputing that
i shall be more specific
i hope that you do
that is what is important
that worries us
ladies and gentlemen
the debate is closed
within what limits
under what jurisdiction
international waters are affected
the debate is closed
1
it is a good thing
the budget is approved
2
i agree with that
i declare the sitting resumed
are there any comments
the sanctions must stop
the debate is closed
europe has that experience
much more is needed
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
experts must be involved
the ground is still contaminated
thank you  commissioner
the debate is closed
it merits our support
today it is
i am very grateful indeed
we will have more democracy
it is a european ‘no’
european democracy is incomplete
i find that unacceptable
thank you  mr president
we should listen to them
europe deserves better
it is something i reject
– mr nikiforos diamandouros
– mr giuseppe fortunato
a secret ballot was held
members voting  643
votes cast  609
majority required  305
the results were as follows
nikiforos diamandouros 564 votes
giuseppe fortunato 45 votes
congratulations  mr diamandouros
that concludes the vote
recommendation  nicholson  a6 0001/2005
that is fantastic progress
‘no’ to the constitutional treaty
we will be there
the document is not perfect
thank you
i thank you
why
i think not
thank you
thank you
no means no
centralised  the european union
some superstate
advances have been made
they are perhaps insufficient
the debate is closed
that is entirely false
her reply has satisfied me
many thanks
you have that power
let us decide
is that still your opinion
is that so  mr juncker
is that the case
i have four questions
finally  the fourth area
thank you  mr president
it depends on us
what should therefore be done
the debate is closed
the answer is no
the answer is no

the idea is very appealing
the amount continues to rise
this must be reviewed
our aid must be visible
ownership matters
would that be possible
thank you
i apologise  mr president
i had hoped for better
i voted against the resolution

the matter is closed
there is a problem here

what task remains
thank you  mr president
i thank you
finally  the reconstruction
the debate is closed

i thank you
i thank you
thank you  mr president
courage and caution are needed

goodness gracious me
the situation is clearly disappointing

this is vitally important
for me it is simple
define the target group
thank you  mr president
this is very pleasing
thank you very much
thank you
i thank you
that is a sensitive subject
the debate is closed
what is to be done
not at all
that is our position
the debate is closed
thank you  mr president
thank you
i thank you

thank you
the debate is closed
i thank you
another question was about audiovisuals
the debate is closed
thank you
thank you mr president
so far  so good
this is absolutely impracticable
the debate is closed
it made me look stupid
the union could do better
why is that the case
quite the opposite
let me analyse this
thank you
quite right
i thank you
many thanks
they have done their homework
what is the european dimension
just listen  please
you know i am right
six percentage points
that difference no longer exists
what are we doing

what is to be done
that is vital
your request is accepted
thank you
i apologise for that
that concludes the vote
overloaded bureaucracy
it is perfect
thank you for your attention
sadly  it seems not
that is patently stupid

those statements are unambiguous
i thank you

nevertheless  we remain open
the debate is closed
why is this so
there are two main reasons
the debate is closed
is everyone a loser
consumption is rising
we have to do something
the debate is closed
that threatens safety
many thanks
the debate is closed
what is this debate about
the wording is important
let me explain
we respect their stance
the debate is closed
the sitting is open
we all know about this
it is modern slavery
we heard nothing about it
this is entirely untrue
thank you

i thank you
thank you  mr president
i thank you
the debate is closed
not before time
there are other possibilities
there are others
the debate is closed
the situation is now clear
work with us
this image is disastrous
this is stupid and dangerous
we should limit it
i thank you
that is the first issue
software is a language
who makes the laws
we want both of them
the debate is closed
however  enforcement remains weak
thank you commissioner
thank you for your answer
thank you
is this sufficient
thank you
the debate is closed
this should be changed
the commission welcomes this report
that is very important
many thanks
we are disappointing the citizens
the debate is closed
now we see change
now we look ahead
we look ahead to budgetisation
the debate is closed
section i – european parliament
section ii – council
[2004/2271 bud ];
many thanks
the joint debate is closed
many thanks
the debate is closed
i thank you
that constitutes ‘better law making’
be careful
what does that mean
we have no choice
is that possible
yes  it is
what must we not do
that is no solution
it is not realistic
i am pleased about that
the debate is closed
i voted for the report
i voted for the report
as i have always advocated
this report is highly critical
what exactly do we want
thank you
thank you
it is useless
dump it
that is important
the debate is closed
they should be released immediately
the situation is kafkaesque
the eu can do more
the debate is closed
does he agree with that
that much is clear
that is the question
that is the programme
that is very clear
is he still there
that concludes question time
both are needed
i really appreciate this support
it is crucial
and so on

i will continue in swedish
i thank you
many thanks  mr president
i thank you
thank you  mr president
i have five proposals
i thank you
the fourth is capacities
the debate is closed
have you checked this
the procedure is extremely vague
the debate is closed
i thank you
why is this
how would it be funded
the debate is closed
nevertheless  imports will increase
will it be the farmers
thank you
that should not happen
– thank you mr president
that would be good news
the debate is closed
thank you
we must redouble our efforts
gestures are not enough
i thank you
why
this must not happen
the debate is closed
nothing has happened
that has to stop
it is a despicable practice
but it did not happen

thank you  mr medina
there are several oral questions
mr cavada has the floor
that is a lot
please  though
next  fundamental rights
why
thank you
– the debate is closed
the debate is closed
what should we be visualising
it is also feasible
is that even technically possible
that is very important
why
so what do we need
bold subsidies are needed
the sitting is closed
their response was favourable
what are the issues here
europe needs and deserves better
we do not accept it
lazarus indeed strikes once more
that is also our line
uncertainty is very expensive
you are right
it is not
that is my observation
something must be wrong
why was this necessary
i represent the european council
the debate is closed
that is a major success
‘1
‘2
3
i am not that naive
it is a project
it is a common desire
why all of these words
that is good news
this needs to be remedied
i voted in favour
nothing has been done
these manoeuvres are absurd
thank you mr president
thank you
thank you  mr president
why is there unemployment
they are chiefly weak states
the debate is closed
these reforms really are important
it is a good concept
two points nonetheless
military capacity is essential
that is defending the indefensible
you have two choices
who is elected
that concludes question time
what is this about
the debate is closed
why
it does not stop there
– good evening  mr president
the debate is closed
that is true
it is not good enough
what is the truth today
what is the truth today
thank you for your attention
thank you
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the problem is two fold
consequently
the debate is closed
what does this mean
thank you mr president
thank you
the resolution is very clear
the debate is closed
it comprises five chapters
the debate is closed
the figures are clear
this is an intolerable situation
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
i thank mr coveney
i hope so
i congratulate him
– the debate is closed
where do they occur
the debate is closed
thank you
how can it be possible
i thank you
that is a fact
we are also living longer
it provides security
modernisation is required
the patient is a customer
the debate is closed
i thank you
i thank you
the debate is closed
we address similar priorities
what wisdom did it bestow
thank you  mr president
thank you
it will attract investors’ interest
here is the first
what problems have become apparent
that concludes the debate
that concludes the debate
the debate is closed
those are my points
why has it not happened
12 pollutants were identified
the commission regrets this approach
this directive is needed
just a quick second point
– the debate is closed
what should we do
thank you
they cannot be separated out
that concludes the debate
the commissioner himself was here
thank you
is that correct  general morillon
would you mind repeating it
to replace by text
that is politically inept
why is this so
thank you  mr schulz
furthermore  it
no amendments have been proposed
no amendments have been proposed
no amendments have been proposed
no amendments have been proposed
that is reprehensible
that concludes this item
time will tell
they fear the truth
they are in my prayers
this was a foul murder
it should do so immediately
i welcome them here today
they have refused
they too must be condemned
the facts are sobering
i support both those ideas
the debate is closed
i wish this directive well
is it safe or not
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
my theory is as follows
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
that is my first answer
the debate is closed
terrorism is a terrible thing
thank you  commissioner
that concludes the debate
why
what about flexibility though
it has
the stakes are nonetheless important
it is a mockery
this has produced good results
this is a minimum directive
that is the first thing
that is simply not true
it is excessive and wrong
and  if so  why
the debate is closed
the vote will be tomorrow
i was shocked
and
i have two concerns
there can be no exceptions
we should make progress
that is not enough
targets were mentioned
the debate is closed
this project must be stopped
the debate is closed
however  i have some comments
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
that is the situation
you set an example
the conclusion is clear
never mind the cynics
you need to respond instantly
we need that park
so this is all possible
we all make mistakes
all this work has started
this is extremely important
that concludes question time
my apologies for this
the definition is clear
let me clarify that
the debate is closed
21 amendments must be rejected
you can do it
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
they will not cooperate
people are suffering
the debate is closed
they could have done so
why do i say so
what is our objective
that situation must end
the debate is closed
this principle is not disputed
the european union
in particular
hence our vote against
they aren't
we ought never to forget
what losses
they were not liberated
how many lost opportunities
churchill was right
why
i never saw him
it is a hell ’
we are alive
thank god
i quote
what war has it stopped
the debate is closed
it will not succeed
what are we doing
this is a serious issue
have you set a timetable
i find this very heartening
this work is very encouraging
that concludes question time
that is noted  mr crowley
the item is closed
that is my clarification
you must not say that
that concludes the debate
the debate is closed
this has to change
we made progress in paris
let me finish there
i have faith in you
and i reject that
the debate is closed
now many have
this is being undertaken
that is a good start
so his approach is correct
why
the debate is closed
only facts matter
amen
it is a terrible idea
it is not very clear
that is a good start
ladies and gentlemen
thank you for the debate
the debate is closed
the second occupation
thank you  colleagues
i congratulate our colleagues here
we cannot
the rapporteur is right
that is a good start
just a few certainties
it is  nonetheless  fundamental that
we are counting on you
i have no water
the animals are thirsty’
why
i have now confirmed this
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
thank you  mr mayor oreja
thank goodness for
let me explain why
‘eur 120 ’ she said
it matters to me
the debate is closed
i am very sorry
it is a complex process
– the debate is closed
this concerns us all
this should be the aim
and rightly so
and rightly so
these are concrete actions
the debate is closed
let me say two things
i congratulate the rapporteur
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
money laundering …
there is no interpretation
no way
we find this regrettable
many thanks  mr nassauer
the debate is closed
because what do we find
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
why do we need legislation
the debate is closed
let me explain
– the debate is closed
that is very important
what is this regulation about
i have three points
it is overregulation
no one wants that
the second point concerns alcohol
and so we should
it contested the procedure
the debate is closed
that has to be avoided
– the debate is closed
there is competition
– the debate is closed
these are our priorities
the answer is no
finally  unfairly treated groups
europe is not working well
the debate is closed
the rest is unchanged
i ask for your support
are there any objections
i therefore voted in favour
thank you for your votes
my criticism lies elsewhere
last thursday  we
many thanks
it must also act
what is happening
nothing has happened
energy brings synergy
we will continue our work
that concludes the debate
quite the opposite
the debate is closed
this is an old idea
this is a major question
the debate is closed
why is this being done
that is the goal
the debate is closed
it involves competition
the debate is closed
we are mad
we need both
can we not do better
the debate is closed
that is no small thing
what are these victories
they feed it
is it fanaticism
that is the easy answer
what is our stand today
that is the solution
the first is impossible
the chinese have other definitions
that is one point
have they had an effect
what effect have they had
are any specific measures dispensable
the debate is closed
that is where we are
we need it
why these thanks
how can we achieve that
indeed it does
two obstacles remain
my group supports this report
is this a sensible development
the obvious answer is no
thank you mr wynn
they said ‘yes’
our proposal is a compromise
that is not defensible
this is nonsense
how
europe has run aground
the presidency proposes more
europe needs solidarity
pass your resolution
that is my appeal
that concludes the debate
that concludes question time
why is this so
that is not desirable
thank you
the debate is closed
this is  of course  unacceptable
this is entirely hypocritical
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
and health
no
the debate is closed
a new opportunity had arisen
nevertheless  things change
that is very important
i already knew that
that is the first priority
thank you  commissioner
that concludes the debate
is hope changing sides
i do not think so
it has never existed
d for democracy and dialogue
who could claim to be
we need to reflect
they need to be ratified
why is there this gulf
the public feel this gulf
it does not work
enlargement must remain a possibility
it has to reform
let us get to work
so  what do we do
what is to be done
europe is in crisis
we must act now
the matter is urgent
stop tormenting the constitution
what is to be done
i would beg to differ
start afresh
read our proposal
this should not be forgotten
that is surely wrong
we need an instrument
i think not
we have an institutional problem
we have to move forward
the debate is closed
– the mask has slipped
this will take time
thank you  mr bonde
please sit down
thank you  mr cavada
it is 1 15 p m
in light of
1
2
3
explanations of vote
this is a major task
the story is old hat
that is absolutely meaningless
these things will never happen
our work is badly organised
this is a great innovation
that is a fact
why
a greater consensus is needed
the debate is closed
how can it do this
these have been mentioned
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
you mentioned taxation
i find that very frustrating
that concludes question time
stability is necessary
the opposite has happened  however
my conclusion is clear
what could parliament do
what could my group do
why
the debate is closed
the challenges are huge
the debate is closed
the commission supports these amendments
the debate is closed
that concludes this item
unfortunately  it would appear not
take tuna  for example
the fishermen of cyprus …
– the debate is closed
their days are now numbered
let us consider the facts
the debate is closed
this is no coincidence
it was about time
that is not enough  however
european values are universal
congratulations  csaba
the fight will go on
the debate is closed
not much
so what happens
– the debate is closed
the debate is closed
if only it could
– the debate is closed
thank you very much
are there any comments
hello
today we have a disagreement
with enthusiasm
more work is needed
but let us be frank
this is wisdom itself
we must look forward
we must avoid that risk
what follows now
what is our goal
you were right there
let us summarise
what contempt for the law
the constitution is dead
you are wasting time
let us  rather  start afresh
yes  the world is changing
europe has to adapt
the dutch ‘no’ is final
nothing changes
who to choose
big
rich
active
i do not think so
we are ready for it
it was a huge disappointment
nobody talked about europe
roll on the british presidency
well  let us do it
who wishes for that
who wants that
what will happen
will we get our money
the debate is closed
that is the legal basis
it is tragic
we will realise it
the debate is closed
it did not happen
that is the first step
congratulations  michael
– the debate is closed
remember the aeroplane hijacks
how does terrorism develop
who feeds it
– the debate is closed
two issues concern me  however
this example is not unique
– the debate is closed
some have committed suicide
the debate is closed
what do we want
that storm abated
– the debate is closed
it always will be
consider this
just reflect
did it
has it succeeded
are we listening
third  implement the lisbon agenda
they are posing the questions
you spoke about respect
that is indeed the case
first  council transparency
second  parliamentary scrutiny
third  public debate
show it
you are right
very good
why are you ignoring them
who are these people
what are these plans
no
it is a quick win
i want europe to change
sticking plaster politics do not work
that concludes the debate
i thank you for that
an ordered rectification is required
go to see mr chirac
buy him dinner
how much is europe worth
that makes no sense mathematically
that brings us to today
alright
that is something i understand
you can count on us
the debate is closed
that concludes the vote
here we go again
this is quite intolerable
let us keep question time
we are not begging
the memory calls for justice
thank you
that concludes this item
the debate is closed
to what is this attributable
credibility is in short supply
for that we are grateful
so rejoice
that debate is now over
mr president
i will mention two things
thank you  mr trichet
it deserves to be thanked
he stood his ground
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
i very rarely get furious
the debate is closed
the result is extremely good
the debate is closed
there are three issues
the best way is freedom
what is the biggest problem
they explicitly support it
why abolish copyright
the important thing is lisbon
that should be stressed
that concludes the vote
a warm welcome to you
we even note a paradox
please continue
i shall be very brief
hence our vote
a potemkin policy
nonsense
the commission accepts this
these policies must be optimised
those are areas under threat
why
europe must display solidarity
why
we have lost out
the debate is closed
let us be frank
what are the real circumstances
the murderers are free
that is the reality
that is the situation
i offer my congratulations
the debate is closed
it has an economic value
what about your actual timetable
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
i ask for your forbearance
the debate is closed
we have two objectives
this is not the case
let us change the rules
why
the council came after us
the debate is closed
the first concerns cumulation
the debate is closed
i am turning it
i am turning the page
that is our bottom line
why
it is ethically irresponsible
how
many deficiencies  however  still remain
that is the truth
the occupying forces must leave
they need to understand that
we have lived through it
the occupying army must leave
let us speak the truth
long live democracy
long live freedom
long live self determination
i still do
why
i am not naive
the debate is closed
mandela was right
why
africa has changed
finally  the world has changed
the first axis is governance
it is  however  vital
a round for free
i wish you success
our action must be clear
we can all
three things
he is quite right
that is the first point
not at all
we know that
the debate is closed
that is one suggestion
this is also my opinion
hence our vote against
this is unacceptable
the debate is closed
nevertheless  concerns remain
i will stop here
is that really so
is not this hypocrisy
none whatsoever
that is simply not true
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
very good
has it already been
these are specific questions
that ends question time
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
this practice must be stopped
urgent action must be taken
it is stuck in council
that is pretty minimal
the debate is closed
first of all  free competition
the debate is closed
their accession is guaranteed
we have given our word
the debate is closed
how has it been enriched
why
that cannot be true
we need you
that really would be regrettable
it is worth it
this is a growing sector
the money must be secure
is this an appropriate ratio
many thanks
– the debate is closed
are there perhaps other variations
will they get their goods
i congratulate the rapporteur
the idea is absurd
these events are ongoing
i have requested information
that loophole must be closed
my compliments to mrs saïfi
– that concludes voting time
i strongly support the motion
i genuinely regret that
it is a demographic power
what can we do
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
we agree about that
obviously  i agree
that needs to be acknowledged
what should be done
this is disgraceful
the debate is closed
thank you  mr poettering
it is incomprehensible
mr president
thus far  they have refused
that concludes this item
it is horrendous
we too are with them
this is absolute nonsense
what does that mean
better regulation
it is impossible to operate
the debate is closed
thank you
thank you
progress depends on them
etymologists set us thinking
the debate is closed
we produce a great deal
it is not information
let us stop doing so
television is without frontiers
the debate is closed
that concludes the vote
that is unacceptable
‘make poverty history’
there is no development
think about the people
we cannot accept it
why not wait for that
but why
no chance
nothing much has changed
i find this highly regrettable
but what a mockery
our arguments have not succeeded
on the contrary
it was a comprehensive reply
my answer is no
is it the american authorities
the airline companies
european authorities
that concludes question time
our work is essential
thank you  mr president
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
to help the single market
it is  however  a reality
why
let us make no mistake
what is europe good for
your vote will be decisive
they could not understand it
nevertheless  we must be demanding
why is that
the debate is closed
time is pressing upon us
this really has to stop
that goes without saying
the costs are
i am a european muslim
balance is essential
how should we act now
that concludes the debate
the presidency must do something
that concludes the vote
that treaty has been rejected
that is not very convincing
that goes without saying
how should this be approached
the settlers have left gaza
this is an achievement
the debate is closed
this needs to be addressed
thank you
all of that is good
it is an excellent report
the debate is closed
tell us the truth
that is our political task
the debate is closed
here is another example
why
is it really necessary
no  they are not
are they meeting quality targets
the answer is ‘no’
the classes are too large
letters are going unanswered
what about multilingualism
that is the main issue
the debate is closed
it is our sea
why
they need to work together
the debate is closed
in other words
that i regard as improper
i spoke for two minutes
that is a promise
the debate is closed
the story goes on
– that concludes voting time
let us not disappoint them
such shortcomings must be remedied
there are many other solutions
we bear a huge responsibility
why
we have not
not to any adequate extent
the debate is closed
must we do the same
aid is finally there
for africa
that is the problem
what is the situation today
the debate is closed
that is immaterial
everyone is persecuted
these statistics are truly alarming
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
no amendments have been proposed
mr watson confirms that
no amendments have been proposed
that possibility exists
those problems are still there
we did so
that is unacceptable
our approval is your legitimacy
what happened
full stop
is that better regulation
we want a parliament
the debate is closed
is that alright with europe
simon wiesenthal died
– the debate is closed
thank you  europe
this vision remains relevant today
i experienced this myself
the debate is closed
level one  codecision
i will make three remarks
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
i have a few questions
the debate is closed
what do we want
we must protect the refugees
that is all very generous
which are these safe countries
alas  poor us
i understand this need well
we should not automatically presume
the debate is closed
long live european wine
what will happen to them
that is an important point
that goes without saying
the debate is therefore closed
thank you for that clarification
are there any comments
for our europe
what is territorial cohesion
it aims for territorial integration
the regions are artificial
we do it with resignation
thank you  mr kilroy silk
nonetheless  it remains a dream
thank you  commissioner
it is an interesting case
forget competition
the question is straightforward
what is the reason
have you received them
thank you for your cooperation
that is the reason
yes  we did
this is about enlargement
just shut up  will you
that is a legitimate debate
is islam european
i stand by that
good
they perceive things differently
that is courageous
why is this so
turkey bans him
that is racism
this ban is racism
it is an insult
what has happened
that is completely unacceptable
let us be consistent
those conditions have been met
that is not justice
what hypocrisy
and europe for that matter
that should be our objective
the debate is closed
i am delighted
i shall read it out
that says it all  really
what a revelation
that is on the table
the answer  unfortunately  is 'no'
1
is progress being made
the debate is closed
what were the achievements
this is disappointing
that must change
thank you
we need a parliamentary component
nothing has changed
what does all that mean
that is our problem
why is this so important
the debate is closed
'yes  minister '
that concludes question time
talk is not enough
thank you  mr rehn
the debate is closed
– thank you  mr president
what a disgrace
the debate is closed
we need ownership unbundling
the debate is closed
these are glaring differences
i find this irresponsible
the debate is closed
their lives are shattered  amputated
first of all law enforcement
the results are noticeable
was it a false alarm
the debate is closed
it waited too long
what did we do
the debate is closed
she will have mine
what has changed
that is something different
i have no other option
–  b6 0461/2005   oil
bioenergy is unnecessary
this is a shocking figure
however  we have several reservations
that is easy to demonstrate
that makes me optimistic
the debate is closed
it is long overdue
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
this has not happened
this has not happened
oppression breeds oppression
all these things are unacceptable
this is our duty
thank you for your attention
the debate is closed
that is not on
i oppose the motion
this work needs to continue
we already have the answer
our futures are interdependent
why
is that acceptable
what is the solution
what  then  can be done
we await some answers
that is not true
migration has many causes
many sleepless nights
the debate is closed
of course they are
what does that mean
the debate is closed
thank you
do you understand
the truth is killing us
thank you for that
first principle  equality
second principle  partnership
third principle  appropriation
the primary responsibility is theirs
africa must help itself
they are based in europe
that is your challenge
yet  the results were insignificant
i am like you
is it enough
the debate is closed
sounds familiar
how wrong we were
i still am
that is what i believe
the debate is closed
on our housing crisis
not our charlie
we already have objectives
what are those resources
we pay the bills
we have listened very carefully
the debate is closed
thank you
thank you
that concludes the vote
i therefore voted in favour
the extra information is crucial
this is unacceptable
this is very regrettable
hence our abstention
why women
debate without resolution
1
obviously he is right
i hope we will
that concludes question time
this represents a great change
the debate is closed
cooperation has been excellent
that is the first step
congratulations  mrs gröner
thank you
the debate is closed
we fully understand that concern
this is a paltry amount
point duly made
thank you
they were conceived together
there are 77 amendments
thank you
of course not
it has an economic dimension
the debate is closed
european legislation is still fragmented
– the debate is closed
the common position is disappointing
this is an environmental issue
– the debate is closed
regulation  2003/0189a  cod
directive  2003/0189b  cod
the essential questions are clear
we should embrace it
to that we are opposed
this is a strategic choice
that is my first observation
why
no
is it more protectionist
is it discriminatory
the answer is no
you should think carefully
they lost  however
they most certainly do
the debate is closed
these plans must seek to
do we have 25%
i shall close here
we have seen that
is there an epidemic
has the virus attacked man
yes it has
is there a vaccine
money is therefore required
we have to be ready
sometimes the media exaggerate
that will happen
the debate is closed
why not say it
we are building our partnership
not just spaniards
many times
that concludes voting time
well  that is propaganda
that is unacceptable
will it take action
there is no need yet
that too must be debated
this is naturally unacceptable
that is true  moreover
there are numerous examples
that  unfortunately  is not possible
we all agree
that is the situation today
perhaps you can enlighten us
– i come from scotland
that concludes question time
we shall examine
first  what is the budget
we are doing our best
the earthquake represents a challenge
i do not know
what happened
we got nothing
this situation cannot continue
that is not the case
quite right too
however  that is not enough
when
the debate is closed
i welcome this
how is this growth measured
no
it is no such thing
for what reason
thank you  mr blair
you have the floor
that is our desire
let me be clear
it is followership
go on  laugh
so what has happened since
why
of course not
we can do it
they are posing the questions
time is short  winter approaches
we are waiting for you
zero progress
the inspiration has broken down
do not disappoint them
stop disappointing them
thank you mr blair
what  then  should we do
that concludes the item
how very cynical
thank you for your response
my question is a follow up
that concludes question time
its presence was extremely important
thank you
the country is desperately poor
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
but history is history
one is education
the region is still unstable
these countries must evolve
where are the governments
i agree with it
let me explain
why is that so important
there  i am very hopeful
that concludes the debate
what is this saying
why is this so
the debate is closed
i entirely agree
that is the only change
we shall proceed as planned
amendment 263
amendment 440
they were aimed at
hence our vote in favour
that has not been done
that is fair enough
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
that has not happened
the debate is closed
the vote is closed
time is pressing
everything comes from china
this is the reality
this is the reality
what are the results
by exploiting people
how can artisans survive
no one
– the debate is closed
that is a considerable advantage
our society has changed
the debate is closed
the precedents are not encouraging
why
the commission did nothing
this must be answered
we must defend our values
no  we do not
no  we do not
the debate is closed
i suggest two solutions
the debate is closed
the directive fulfils this objective
the debate is closed
and on the outside
a great loss of credibility
a scandal
more of the same
very bad
and the member states
where is the british presidency
where is the british presidency
this really is scandalous
the member states are happy
they are pleased with themselves
my conscience is clear
enough said
these objectives remain pertinent
i agree
there must be balance
let us be frank
quite the contrary
just a suggestion
drafting a legislative programme
to deal with what
it is a strange document
colleagues were talking about priorities
good
agreed
i await your response
this work is now beginning
the debate is closed
thank you  mrs gröner
this is indeed the case
that will be the day
let us not spoil it
never
we cannot spoil it
humans are  nevertheless  mortal
finally  sacconi’s apple
that remains a major problem
a nightmare
the two are directly connected
why is this
how is the product used
how can it be identified
the debate is closed
the number has grown enormously
what of accountability
we vote their budget
the debate is closed
could you explain why
i do not believe so
that is very important
the investigation has made progress
all that is in progress
however  the investigation continues
that concludes question time
that is unacceptable
i truly meant it
it is no such thing
what would the alternative be
the debate is closed
the results are encouraging
furthermore  it is environmentally friendly
it is a huge challenge
this is a tragic truth
the diagnosis has been made
we need targets
the debate is closed
nothing so far has happened
i voted for this report
hence our abstention
the climate is changing
the fourth concern was energy
this is not the case
why not
not at all
why abandon this draft
today  there is a vacuum
why
that is a fact
that is the problem
we are working through it
the budget was mentioned
for that i am grateful
let us be frank
and that is the point
are we ready
can we deliver
of course it is not
that is the great challenge
i believe it is possible
the debate is closed
these are deeply troubling statements
that is our way
the debate is closed
– thank you mr president
why
thank you for your response
the debate is closed
the figures are clear
secondly  the heading is incorrect
arms are dangerous
the answer is ‘no’
contracts must be transparent
please
here we go
good luck
long may it so remain
those days are over
i welcome its proposals
not one
why not
we could debate this together
it would be worthwhile
this is not insignificant
in conclusion  i assume so
i have to be pragmatic
the debate is closed
what is it all about
the debate is closed
people’s lives depend upon it
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
perhaps
the debate is closed
that is not acceptable
of course we will
but they must do something
i do not think so
thirdly  i will mention agriculture
is that fair
is that a fair system
the offer is not perfect
i really cannot believe that
why
that is quite enough
the results are enormously impressive
it must be balanced
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
i support this resolution
there you go
was this a romantic move
surely not for the children
romantic
the debate is closed
that is totally unacceptable
what then
i think not
what exactly has he achieved
nothing
let us protect the institutions
it is a great opportunity
we salute him for that
this is very important
amendments no  2  4 1   4 2
there are many positive points
that is the good news
the debate is closed
that is very important
the procedure has worked well
it works
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the current exemption is unique
is it already ready
today  things have changed
the debate is closed
that is not regularly enough
therefore these are indisputable advantages
the debate is closed
this is still the case
however  there are some conditions
taxes steer
is this madness
an aberration
it has created jobs
the debate is closed
germany is opposed to this
have i understood that correctly
the debate is closed
that is a principle
hence our vote against
hence our vote against
unemployment
absurd budgetary constraints
world trade is unequal
it is unfair
that is the situation
1
we feared the worst
we were not wrong
that is totally incorrect
the debate is closed
rapporteur  joahnnes blokland  a6 0335/2005
we support it
she forgot about luxembourg
the debate is closed
what is this about
why is this so
the debate is closed
such are the consequences
the debate is closed
this directive is really necessary
the debate is closed
the report is ambitious
what causes the concern then
it does not make sense
that is not the case
this is erroneous
the debate is closed
we refuse to accept this
first  there is the budget
the debate is closed
1
the outcome speaks for itself
the facts are as follows
the debate is closed
that concludes the vote
‘equal opportunities for all
towards a just society ’
what a departure
1
2
in return
it is disgraceful
this point refers to
what an interesting idea
we have reduced the requirements
legislate honestly
a constitutional crisis could arise
shall we do so
long live freedom
perhaps we are rushing things
it was a good compromise
i disagree
i am against this proposal
the debate is closed
what has happened about guantánamo
what action has it taken
i could mention other cases
i think this is important
the debate is closed
the answer is simple
that is a major achievement
that was a serious matter
the debate is closed
why is this directive necessary
i did hear you
that concludes this item
that cannot be right
thank you  commissioner
let us not tempt fate
now  the day has come
that is unacceptable
we thank him in particular
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
this is a fact
i will stop there
the debate is closed
what happens after 2006
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
but we must be coherent
i remain convinced of that
but europe has responded
i wish you success
nuclear energy
do you understand
yes  honestly
we are always stopping you
get rid of us
kick us out
expel us
that was never intended
so we should
thank you
christmas is coming
i was wrong
that is blackmail
we had to be disappointed
colleagues  please be quiet
behold the unmasked eu
congratulations  mr president
that concludes the vote
mrs hauwa ibrahim
we admire your determination
we admire your personal commitment
thank you very much
vaclav havel’
we do not know
that is what we knew
there were eight mullahs
i walked towards them
sit on that chair’
and i said  ‘i am
i caught their attention
nothing more
we needed safety
and that is my passion
they are illiterate and poor
it has to be reformed
our methodology will be flexible
thank you so much
thank you  jean marie
that is not my problem
that is all
yes  we need to reflect
speak the truth
this injustice is unacceptable
the fact that it works
whom did you meet
whom did you sit beside
it is also ineffective
why do they think that
hence our vote against
it has many defects
this is an unsatisfactory law
torture is abhorrent
the council welcomes this statement
you wicked girl
no  indeed not
what was their status
this is not the truth
indeed  we condemn it
the debate is closed
this initiative deserves our support
why is this the case
we represent their best hope
the debate is closed
that single seat is strasbourg
well done
who gains
question time is closed
the first declaration reads
this is a real shame
– the debate is closed
that focus has been lost
why is that so important
– the debate is closed
just so
– the debate is closed
there must be proportionality
that would greatly help
this is unacceptable and unworkable
it does not exist
this situation is intolerable
– the debate is closed
i beg the house’s indulgence
1
2
the figures speak for themselves
this amount is obscene
hence our vote against
the debate is closed
lebedev is seriously ill
i hope reason prevails
it concerns us all
– thank you mr president
thank you
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
that concludes the vote
it is unimaginable
this is clearly a slight
nothing
thank you
take the liberals
i am gay
why
the debate is closed
answer for yourselves
citizenship belongs to nation states
i do not want it
– the debate is closed
who is to blame
it was surely inevitable
madam president
that concludes the debate
i want to do that
these are my preliminary thoughts
this effort unites us
it is a common challenge
and push we must
we can do good
i detect two worrying reactions
what a disappointment
those are positives
those are essential
it is a formidable list
no
no
this is an important point
that is their choice
why
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
why is this so
the answer is quite simple
consequently …
these are big numbers
who really wants this directive
we know how they operate
– thank you mr president
it is therefore unacceptable
thank you for your attention
that is the situation  however
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
1

this was indeed madness
where will this madness end
that is not enough  however
are there any objections
reality calls for courage
that is quite an achievement
not one
are there any possible alternatives
it is not a company
the debate is closed
this had three main elements
of course it does not
on the contrary
thank you  commissioner
thank you  commissioner
that concludes question time
but are we crazy
is the commission
the debate is closed
take a current example
the debate is closed
thank you  mr sjöstedt
the debate is closed
i support the directive
the debate is closed
i therefore support this directive
the debate is closed
we need that balance
why not
this is european taxpayers’ money
i find that incredibly interesting
they are a political matter
europe is teamwork
it must be earned
that is europe’s crisis
you did not say that
wonderful
we are for that too
then we come to growth
good luck
what a wonderful agenda
the money is actually there
do that
take real action
i could go on
open the doors
transform yourself
become a european enlightener
let us get to work
it has many facets
they are still here
i think it is
that would be a success
you are sure to succeed
can you explain how
keep that squarely in mind
why
we have procrastinated long enough
we must now take decisions
the debate is closed
this is not much  though
that is regrettable
it must be rejected
that is absurd
this is fundamental for us
i therefore condemn their ploys
i object to this
paragraph 45
the following are examples
– employment and social integration
that is absolutely vital
what does this opinion say
it is a serious problem
it is not like that
that is a step forward
why break your own rules
use them
nonsense
you lost
that is the reality
they are not proposing anything
why
what is this work
the debate is closed
it is dead
this is scandalous and unacceptable
that is our task now
we cannot remain indifferent
strasbourg is our only hope ’
lastly  today’s resolution
the debate is closed
do we have any options
if so  what are they
we are doing our best
that concludes question time
i wonder why not
i am worried
today  the situation is different
point 4  criteria
four freedoms should be analysed
thank you
that is very important
that is already under way
why
– the debate is closed
firstly  simplifying bureaucracy
who could disagree with that
how
– the debate is closed
that is not the case
that is intolerable
the debate is closed
they are very happy
i clearly reiterated that
good morning  mr president
we know that
the debate is closed
thank you  everyone
these studies are published
how
so where is the snag
this will not be achieved
the debate is closed
i live with diabetes
i doubt it
for four years
long live death
but are we crazy
how can we accomplish anything
dialogue  yes  but about what
1

this should be remedied
it is horrific
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
we support the resolution
the negotiations are underway
the debate is closed
let us start there
the debate is closed
that was my original intention
that concludes the vote
this time they were slovakian
are there any comments
mrs frassoni has the floor
thank you  ladies and gentlemen
i could not agree more
this is not the case
what can be observed
what should be done  then
but they were betrayed
have we made mistakes
so take note of that
the debate is closed
we must respect this will
yes  hamas won
palestine is occupied
i beg to differ
what will we do then
under which conditions
do we have any plans
we know why
the debate is closed
we can wait no longer
it would be absurd
the debate is closed
this is an important point
what is happening
so publish it
this question seems very technical
this is not true
this is true
this is a huge exercise
the debate is closed
thank you very much
the debate is closed
the die is cast
may they rest in peace
these are horrific figures
we need to act
so what can we do
that is very important
the debate is closed
the second cause is idleness
the debate is closed
thank you very much  commissioner
is this progress
the debate is closed
we prohibit misleading advertising
on the contrary
the debate is closed
thank you for your attention
this is about engaging citizens
we have to be realistic
we need to debate
the debate is closed
i am certain of that
the answer is no
it is very embarrassing
firstly  tiredness kills
and here we go again
the debate is closed
i therefore voted in favour
it was a powerless rage
hence our vote against
if we condemn cuba
we have voted
it just cannot be true
1
this is therefore unfair competition
thank you
these standards are needed
it is a compromise
the debate is closed
i congratulate the rapporteur
the debate is closed
the same is true today
everyone will benefit
it causes concern and apprehension
the reason is simple
the debate is closed
solvit has been a success
the debate is closed
we are mediators
the debate is closed
i congratulate mrs weisgerber
why should they not
what do you think  thomas
the debate is closed
i think not
the answer is obvious
thank you
the debate is closed
that must be our approach
the debate is closed
why
their potential is particularly great
you are the rapporteur
that is not acceptable
we doubt it
that we do know
big deal
we shall vote ‘no’
i am simply in awe
this is scandalous
for that reason
that is our aim
my question relates to that
what would its approach be
that concludes question time
but do we know this
is that democracy
we shall support the compromise
we want a better europe
their action is scandalous
it is expensive and ineffective
is that sensible
that really is idiotic
why
i always support it
those are essential
why should they
i welcome that
– the debate is closed
i do not think so
let us choose real freedom
it deserves our full support
the debate is closed
we must safeguard these principles
globalisation has indeed arrived
several people have been killed
indeed  globalisation has arrived
how can europe respond
the debate is closed
we are offering constructive cooperation
we should support this proposal
the stakes are extraordinarily high
what are the facts
today’s iran is potentially dangerous
the debate is closed
that concludes the vote
that is not the solution
the debate is closed
what more can we do
what will happen next
that was known as liberalisation
it is an impoverished country
– thank you  mr president
the debate is closed
this is a historic moment
thank you  commissioner
those discussions are ongoing
i am sorry
that is crucial
all these things matter
that is the reason
on the contrary
this is very important
thank you  commissioner
that concludes question time
the debate is closed
this is quite right
the debate is closed
this is all very well
the debate is closed
all this is nothing new
that is not sufficient  however
that is quite splendid
absolutely not
thank you
that is indeed good news
there is a way
are we brave enough
legal restrictions are needed
thank you in advance
the debate is closed
my congratulations to the rapporteur
– the debate is closed
firstly  the question of rights
the debate is closed
we must learn from them
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
we live in a community
that concludes this item
women need decisive action
the debate is closed
that development will continue
how did we restructure
that is the truth
what shall we do
how can we help
this is the reality
we have a major problem
nothing is working today
that is the problem
– the debate is closed
why do we need one
so be it
that is contrary to fact
that is not the case
i fully support this argument
– the debate is closed
europe must regain its fitness

thank you  mr president
hence our abstention
our proposals were as follows
let me address this briefly
could you answer that
do you recognise that
this is a serious concern
we are behind you
this sampling takes time
i do not understand this
the debate is closed
this change has been radical
congratulations mrs hazan
nothing has happened
– absolutely
that is a crucial aspect
that is another crucial aspect
all power to your elbow
it does not work
are these fears justified
this is much needed
so the risks are limited
this will be negotiated
why laeken
that is the process
i believe that is crucial
poverty naturally breeds poverty
the opposite is the case
the debate is closed
section i – european parliament
section ii – council
section viii a  – european ombudsman
this is a genuine request
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
this is an urgent matter
the debate is closed
good morning  ladies and gentlemen
that is our heartfelt wish
that must be our aim
why was it not used
the israeli action was outrageous
that is also the truth
can we accept that
i would be grateful
no  mr president
let us be clear
however  our systems are fragmented
it is an ambitious project
i apologise for this interruption
no  it is expensive
why  for heaven’s sake
what do we want
the eu is an opportunity
that is the fundamental problem
it is time for action
is that possible
no  it is not
deliver  do not talk
reforms are necessary  though
that has happened now
the debate is closed
– thank you very much
it is therefore important
its profits are growing
i therefore voted in favour
that is the problem
that is disappointing
what are the real questions
the debate is closed
that is the question
these are not logical formulations
they want yet more money
well done  mr kuhne
what are we working on
the debate is closed
i consider that inappropriate
the present discussion is astonishing
does the fusion benefit consumers
does it enhance competition
that is basic
the debate is closed

this is pure nonsense
it has been dealt with
this poses a real threat
the problem lies elsewhere  however
the debate is closed
my question is as follows
the debate is closed
one thing is for sure
thank you
this is a good step
the debate is closed
the many victims demand it
the debate is closed
the process is possible
this is progress
that was a mistake
i have nearly finished
1
so  what about 2007
what does that mean
energy is the fundamental issue
a revised lisbon strategy
of course
fine
a key challenge
agreed
agreed
wonderful
great
that is certain
europe deserves better
no  it has not
there are no clues
what does this mean
it means increased unemployment
it means increased redundancies
look across the wide ocean
they are agreements
montesquieu has been quoted
– the debate is closed
this is absolutely essential
all three should interact
we want growth and employment
will they discuss energy
by how much
it is inadequate
how should this be achieved
i wholeheartedly agree with that
the resolution omits this
who would suffer
germany
commissioners of the split union
we do
this is crucial
solidarity is extremely important
we must help ourselves
the debate is closed
what should our answer be
the debate is closed
time is of the essence
the debate is closed
he is still there today
the debate is closed
we work in tandem  therefore
the debate is closed
do not kid yourselves
that is the reality
why
why
we hear that everywhere
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
many thanks  mr krarup
– thank you madam president
thank you
i took on the challenge
i saw petty smugglers
the debate is closed
this is an unquestionable success
the debate is closed
there are some inconsistencies here
yes  we do
the debate is closed
could you please slow down
after
the following phrase
thanks to brussels
nor should it be
pensioners  take a stand
for what purpose though
long live pensioners
the world is growing older
thank you very much
i shall pass it on
the repression is extremely violent
1
is that your proposal
that delays the debates
that is not possible
this  moreover  is the tragedy
thank you
thank you
thank you
we will provide it quickly
– the debate is closed
this is not right
i consider this wholly insufficient
so that is one stage
the debate is closed
why
it should be combated
the debate is closed
if not now  then when
please open up your doors
we europeans want to participate
the arguments have been won
let us promote our institutions
no
why is it delicate
indeed  we agree with this
where is the council
but that is not enough
i have several points
the debate is closed
they are not
i have several points
will geneva happen
how will it work out
then there is agriculture
the debate is closed
1
2
a final point
three broad areas
you have been warned
thank you  mr president
that is the reality
even they are chinese
farmers are suffering
the debate is closed
what is this fear about
what should the answer be
what do we find
you were right
economic migration is restricted
such cases are quite unacceptable
is that not protectionism
allow me to reiterate
the debate is closed
– that concludes voting time
take the example of services
what a shame
it was a compromise
what do you mean
is it a directive
nothing has changed
it is a good proposal
silence is equivalent to assent
the debate is closed
how can we achieve this
that is what is missing
i will start with simplification
who is mistaken
perhaps nobody is
what is it all about
thank you
the debate is closed
the procedures must be followed
we do care
are these statements accurate
that is the situation
it contains four actions
of course they are not
it was also european
the takkula report is good
one  two  three
what did you hear
absolutely nothing
no
no  again
so here we go again
why
the committee decided against it
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the list is very long
the commissioner may respond today
is that true
the debate is closed
that has now been achieved
the figures speak for themselves
that concludes this item
good
that is our duty
that is our shared responsibility
that is a good sign
that is quite crucial
why is that
good luck
thank you very much
but what happened
i agree
these points were positive
the debate is closed
that is what i did
it adds totality
you have the floor
let us not waste it
naturally  size also matters
thank you
– thank you  mr president
thank you
why rigour
that will take some time
let us seize this opportunity
it is the same water
who wins
no one
it is not possible
this policy is irresponsible
east jerusalem is surrounded
what does that mean
now  does it open possibilities
we have seen that already
mr cohn bendit has changed
i have changed
we have made this known
this house will help
who is mr lukashenko today
the debate is closed
that pretty much covers everything
what of the future
the debate is closed
to save 25 000 lives
yes or no
we believe they should be
the debate is closed
yes
we are making progress
the regulations are clear
have you replied clearly
these obligations must be satisfied
how will it be financed
there are 700 of us
i am really sorry
that concludes question time
the result is devastating
they leave in frustration
the reverse is true
but not all is bleak
the debate is closed
we have already acted
we need to be consistent
i sympathise with the commission
we have an excellent commissioner
– the debate is closed
i find that rather odd
how can that be sensible
we have work in progress
the debate is closed
we also need to deregulate
not very  i am afraid
that is the one message
we can encourage that
the debate is closed
that concludes the vote
three civilians were killed
that is the only solution
it needs to evolve’
the debate is closed
it is not
the violence has to stop
how does that feel
the debate is closed
what can we do
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
are there any comments
we shall see
the victims deserve dignity
nuclear power is not safe
aged reactors are dangerous reactors
people are still dying
do you know why
the debate is closed
thank you for your attention
that is very important
what is happening to them
the debate is closed
what should we be asking
that is very serious
i welcome this stance
where are we now
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
is this really helping democracy
thank you
– the debate is closed
it is now 7 45 p m
– the debate is closed
this is overdue
praise is obviously in order
this is elementary economic logic
this situation is intolerable
and here
this is totally unacceptable
it is only right
paris protects it
why
this debate is very important
so what now
yes or no
yes or no
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
that is of paramount importance
the debate is closed
thank you  mrs frassoni
what is needed
we have witnessed that today
however  i am against it
we are elected legislators
this is our primary objective
therefore  things are moving
the debate is closed
europe is multicultural and multilingual
thank you
is multilingualism on the increase
it is inevitable
– the debate is closed
thank you for your attention
– that concludes voting time
that is wrong
a decision must be made
i find that  if …
1
my parents had no documentation
they use private banks
that will be our responsibility
thank you very much
do we agree with that
do we agree with this
is this surprising
the debate is closed
it does not seem enough
the debate is closed
that is a fact
i do not
thank you for your attention
we believe it does
this is a good result
this regulation will stimulate innovation
it is simple
it is impossible
what will be the result
the debate is closed
what do we propose
that is a clear message
nice
did he not listen
we need reform
what europe
none of us
what europe
what europe
what europe
the europe without enough democracy
what europe
that is going on
what is its objective
what is its purpose
let us be realistic
we have a plan
the constitution is not dead
that was their purpose
the debate is closed
this is a huge figure
the debate is closed
i called you mr berlato
you have the floor
this is incorrect
that concludes the vote
i therefore voted in favour
today  everything fits together
inevitably  there are problems
that constitutes considerable progress
the opposite is the case
they do not deserve that
that is vitally important
we all know that
no  that will not do
corruption – universal
corrections must be possible
the progress is therefore evident
that is important
what do we expect
no
so an unqualified thank you
thank you very much
why
the debate is closed
this is very important
that was crucial
that was a major achievement
we had 150 contributions
that is absolutely vital
a reduction in fuels
of course
that really goes without saying
the debate is closed
this represents a challenge
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
let me give an example
why not
that  of course  is true
that is to be welcomed
i do not think so
we are not without ideas
that is madness
the diagnosis is virtually unanimous
would you believe it
have we learnt nothing
have they achieved this
the debate is closed
is it a good compromise
the challenges are before us
there is acute social insecurity
hence our vote against
that was worthwhile
hence our rejection
hence our decision to abstain
it is the right choice
we can do better
the red indians
who is talking
the policy should be effective
thank you  mr president
my thanks to the rapporteur
are we having an impact
let us work towards this
the debate is closed
these points were accepted
thank you very much
we have to set policy
thank you
it is unnecessarily complicated
that is difficult
that concludes question time
there would be stability
what are these circumstances
how short are your memories
why keep it secret
what priorities are we setting
the debate is closed
we take a different view
these would be constructive arrangements
our group supports this
i rest my case
no
that concludes this item
thank you  mrs krehl
obviously not
that concludes this item
i am not sure
the climate is changing
these reports are well drafted
the debate is closed
that concludes the vote
finally this has taken place
the debate is closed
who should do the talking
the debate is closed
why is this so
taiwan deserves better
the debate is closed
that concludes the vote
the subject is closed
they must have their reasons
europe is lacking in courage
i am not sure
it was clear last year
who would have thought it
the constitution is not dead ’
why do you not listen
stop digging
who is right
we need to know
i think that they can
reality is hard
thank you for your attention
let us start from there
for what purpose
it would lose its identity
could he be more specific
in a word  unacceptable
where to now  europe
guantánamo is in this category
will you make real demands
who knows
the debate is closed
it exists
what investments take place
go to mtu
disputes are normal
thank you
the first is energy
the second topic is iran
that is our big mistake
no
no
that concludes the item
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
childhood is not static
but what is innovation
innovation is not invention
we have wonderful ideas
the debate is closed
the situation could be restored
it lists known truths
can the treaty be modified
of course
the debate is closed
this seems somewhat frustrating
the debate is closed
thank you for your attention
these communities are quite closed
this is a crucial element
the debate is closed
i agree
what does it teach you
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
that is intolerable
what are we waiting for
women want to work
not at all
it remains to be seen
the debate is closed
this is a bad thing
the debate is closed
it is unbearable
what is causing this
the debate is closed
are there any comments
it is very simple
what a disgrace
we do not
new partnership
before political integration
farewell europe  hello world
that is just utter nonsense
1
we support this compromise
this is an enormous improvement
i should
they are worse than useless
why is that the case
europe is weak
we shall carry on working
congratulations  mr potočnik
shall we achieve this  however
thank you
that is a different tune
it can be done
that is their clear answer
the debate is closed
thank you
– that concludes the vote
thank you once again
they have to exist first
cooperation is very important
the debate is closed
that is unacceptable
that is not our role
the debate is closed
energy has already been mentioned
all this is obvious
what did we awake to
how can we do that
the debate is closed
we are following this issue
that concludes question time
this is utterly iniquitous
violation by whom
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
is that something that helps
let us accept that
the debate is closed
why
it is important
they were very ambitious
that is an absolute disgrace
the debate is closed
what stage are we at
no
this is a major issue
these are two key priorities
i do not think so
it is won
this has to change
i cannot understand it ’
i am sorry
that will not be possible
why  then  this deafening silence
what should be done
we congratulate you on it
we must go beyond nice
who is in charge
well done
well done
which country is violating europe
is it russia
no  it is not
well done
it is turkey
well done
it is turkey  well done
well done
why was that
it hinges on policies
which reforms
we need initiatives
no one understands europe
that is very unfortunate
it is true
europe is not in crisis
that is essential
nice is not enough
what is the vision here
well done  mr barroso
the same applies to research
the debate is closed
we should be more modest
that concludes voting time
quite the contrary  in fact
let me be clear
they suffer from social exclusion
that is true
have you heard
have you been listening
have you understood
we need more indicators
the first word is integration
i disagree
why do i say this
what has become of harmonisation
no progress is being made
look at africa
why is that the case
the resolution is clear
the debate is closed
that is beyond dispute
it is absolutely stuff
sorry about that
we need action
why are parades necessary
there is none
we will defend that
is it complacency
is it ignorance
horror is never far away
no  it will not
that is a deep shame
that is very important
the debate is closed
it is life
the debate is closed
have they been solved yet
thank you  mr winkler
thank you for your answer
i am very optimistic
that concludes question time
i applaud the report
– the debate is closed
the debate is closed
i disagree  for two reasons
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
what now though
another huge waste
the debate is closed
mr president  i must insist
congratulations to everybody
it should be continued
this semi legitimation is dangerous
i voted against this
this is a welcome step
hence our abstention
that strikes me as crucial
did i understand him correctly
the debate is closed
they have peaceful intentions
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
thank you very much
everything is connected
the citizens’ initiative www oneseat eu continues
what has actually changed
what has become of those
what exactly has it achieved
think about it
these issues are being discussed
this is a win win situation
we must speak truthfully
we all know this
nobody knows about them  however
i wish them well
the debate is closed
we need to do something
how is that possible
it does not matter
that concludes this item
the first is about solvency
that is a problem
were others notified
that is a key question
is it the commission
the debate is closed
the regulators failed
the regulators failed
i doubt it
the market should decide that
the debate is closed
i deplore that
the debate is closed
that is an absolute must
the debate is closed
i welcome that
the debate is closed
is this an inevitable process
i hope not
do not hold your breath
why is that the case
the debate is closed
we must monitor this situation
the debate is closed
what have we now achieved
thank you  mr blokland
the debate is closed
we all know that spirit
franco lost
they are almost all dead
this has to change
much remains to be done
this is no exaggeration
are they large or small
at last
no
hence our abstention
we therefore voted against
in other words
this is unacceptable
and for what
what is it playing at
taxpayers have been warned
an additional tax
surely not
there will be consolidations
that is good news
so who benefits
so  what is the secret
more needs to be done
the debate is closed
the first point concerns research
it is not
why
why
this must change
thank you
the debate is closed
that is the question
nokia is a good example
am i serious
yes  i am quite serious
so far so good
thank you very much
then please help us
we are committed to this
what is the consequence
i am sorry
that concludes question time
1

the debate is closed
what is this all about
the debate is closed
mr president  i shall conclude
that is the first step
for goodness sake
we need non regression
the debate is closed
this may lead to confusion
the debate is closed
i welcome that debate
i welcome this
their absence is excusable
i would therefore advise caution
do not make me laugh
its coolness is invigorating
this is very discouraging indeed
why not
promises ought to be kept
that is not all  though
we agree
we speak latin in europe
i wish you good luck
secondly  it must be objective
there is an interesting correlation
good luck to the presidency
this chain is necessary
it is not
the debate is closed
i now repeat that call
let us be clear
let us have some consistency
what more does israel want
well how  precisely
this is the main point
it is a vicious circle
the debate is closed
good morning ladies and gentlemen
more or less …
i did check
therefore that was in order
these amendments were as follows
we deeply regret this
hence our abstention
thank you
that is our conclusion
they did nothing
the world is flat
why should we continue
– the debate is closed
emphatically  enough is enough
there are two problems here
that is the structural difference
the debate is closed
now they are french
congratulations
immigrants without papers
no
yes
the debate is closed
that is obvious
the debate is closed
why duplicate this task
i utterly repudiate this approach
they are mocking the world
integration is a two way process
where do we go
what is the situation
what is the position
that is clear to me
the debate is closed
that might help considerably
why not
the debate is closed
so what can we do
the debate is closed
it certainly is not
the debate is closed
this situation is unacceptable
these are the facts
the debate is closed
‘even’
it is an unbelievable figure
remember the tsunami
some summer recess
that is totally unacceptable
we need
why is all this happening
our fears have been realised
his door was always open
com 2005 0261 – c6 0272/2005 – 2005/0130 cns
i wish him good luck
that is simply unacceptable
that is the problem
it is a huge issue
the debate is closed
the best cure is prevention
the debate is closed
that is absurd
why
that shows real urgency
however  that is not enough
do you know
the debate is closed
which belgian economic interests
it needs such investment
why
that is true  mr pflüger
personally  i can do nothing
this is my personal conviction
this is the real debate
the debate is closed
these costs arise
that is the core issue
we want trade
this is a fallacy
i think not
that will take time
the debate is closed
i wonder why …
this is a crime
the debate is closed
this discriminatory situation must stop
this is discrimination
children are also affected
human dignity must come first
we support this
the debate is closed
far from it  in fact
that is of vital importance
moreover  sometimes they are correct
something has to be done
our constituents want reform
– the debate is closed
what has happened
what do they do
the debate is closed
the exact opposite is true
what more can we do
has it been
we do not know
that is the main problem
that concludes question time
the debate is closed
that is extremely important
thank you  john
i shall be brief
– the debate is closed
the debate is closed
what are these values
do they cover human rights
the rights of minorities
yes or no
would we do any better
this is the real problem
it is there in writing
this is obvious  of course
the debate is closed
what is the story here
that is the percentage
is that not the truth
is that not the truth
– that concludes the vote
the answer is  without fear
it is time to react
these objectives are commendable
i believe they are right
what are we aiming for
mr watson is right
it wants an islamic area
we must never forget it
this is our responsibility
yes  it is
what did he expect
the words have been subverted
the war was brewing
we let it brew
it was planned
we did do so
europe must raise its voice
let us look forward
what can we offer there
enough said
his name is renan
he is a dj
where were the international observers
the debate is closed
israel’s action was disproportionate
that concludes question time
please be patient  mr speroni
that is rather revealing
the death penalty
respect for international law
the demilitarisation of security
climate change
that cannot be taken seriously
why
secondly  europol
the reasons are as follows
her commitment is evident
be fair in your
i think we should
we are not naïve
i have a few comments
that is a moral outrage
secondly  there is tibet
thirdly  there is taiwan
this is important
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
and
that is quite clear
two stages are therefore required
it is already an embarrassment
who convened this meeting
what does it mean
why is it necessary
why is it proportionate
why is this
why
what do we need
that is what frightens me
the debate is closed
hence our vote against
this is poor form
this is a bad start
what is to be done
this failure is incomprehensible
we therefore voted against
let me make something clear
– the debate is closed
– the debate is closed
how do things stand
what can we do
can we find other means
– the debate is closed
this is a shame
that is not the problem
i was astounded
is that dialogue
it is a disgrace
that is scandalous
please accept my apologies
thank you
this cannot be accepted
i will start with pm10
why am i saying this
that is our position
thank you very much
thank you
good luck for the future
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
the debate is closed
this is an enormous number
both are necessary
the debate is closed
the commission shares those concerns
the debate is closed
thank you
the debate is closed
such action is essentially pragmatic
that is not on
but what is subsidiarity
of course not
why
it is a trap
what have we achieved
it adds no value whatsoever
what is the right solution
let us acknowledge the fact
i do not agree
that is not the case
what is the agreement about
the debate is closed
reality has borne this out
it is not good enough
we want to change that
it is just a start
thank you
any standardisation must be avoided
hence our abstention
hence our abstention
2015
their voice must be recognised
hence our abstention
the shortcomings must be remedied
forge it with us
we will all be winners
i have had enough
they must become european
unanimity is not required
but how
this is a pity
– the debate is closed
unfortunately they have slowed down
a last major point  cyprus
this situation is preposterous
she speaks of hooligan lawyers
these are serious issues
turkey is calling the shots
that surprises me greatly
how
does that help turkey
i do not think so
it took that step
the debate is closed
you are right
we are working very hard
i have two questions
but that is another matter
that would be very useful
we are working on that
– thank you  commissioner
these letters are handled carefully
the debate is closed
we understand your position
the debate is closed
what will come of this
i speak from experience
i do not exaggerate
why
the debate is closed
sources can be used
the debate is closed
these are
are you sure
it is a pre constitutional debate
indecisiveness reigned supreme
thousands  perhaps
you have been warned
thank you  christoph blocker
long live switzerland
thank you
mr schulz was quite right
the answer is  unfortunately  no
what can we do
that is not on
what can we do
assistance  humanitarian care and return
hence my protest
what has caused the delay
that is deplorable
thank you  minister
the debate is closed
the vote will be tomorrow
is anybody opposed
is anybody opposed
is anybody opposed
wait and see
that would be perfectly natural
when will we ever learn
yet we keep trying again
talk about hypocrisy
why
it is disgraceful
that is unacceptable
this is unfounded
they are greatly mistaken
this situation is totally unbearable
the russians supply the arms
darfur is one of them
no
what steps should be taken
that is another concrete possibility
the debate is closed
this has to change
i shall conclude
it seemed an obvious choice
that all seemed eminently sensible
are we working towards it
has this become a reality
unfortunately  it has not
the debate is closed
that is provocative
finally  let me just say
the answer is  very little
do you remember trade agreements
the debate is closed
let us be clear
those are the facts
the debate is closed
this is an important topic
this report will do nothing
thank you very much
the debate is closed
thank you very much
thank you for the debate
please forgive me
the debate is closed
i welcome this action plan
quite the opposite
what  then  is missing
that is the right order
the debate is closed
so much for the context
that is excellent
i doubt it
the debate is closed
that is completely unacceptable
this procedure is considered fair
about time too
far from it  in fact
we will not stop there

the debate is closed
written statements  rule 149
the debate is closed
